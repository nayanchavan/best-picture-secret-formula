PREPACE

"this first experience with ‘official'
sports was conclusive. Wherever public
authorities undertook to meddle with any
sports organization they introduced the
fatal germs of impotence and mediocrity.
The body formed by the good will of all
the members of an autonomous sport

group becomes swollen to gigantic and
uncertain proportions upon contact with
this dangerous thing called the State."

Baron Pierre de Coubertin
Founder of the Modern Olympics
Paris, July, 1900.

These are sour days in Olympic history. The bureaucracies of
big business and nation states have finally demanded more of
the original slender ideal than it can possibly bear and it's
fatally begun to crack. This year's Olympiad could possibly
be the last.

But it wasn't always so. Back beyond Moscow and Montreal,
Bundage and the big brass bands, Hitler and the Zieg Heils,
was a time when the young people who gathered under the five
rings and flame did so of their own volition. They were
fired by their own purpose, inspired by their own dreams, and
seeking only to test themselves, on their own behalf, against
the fastest, the strongest, the highest on @arth.

Such men were Eric Liddell and Harold Abrahams. The one the
son of a Scots missionary destined to follow in his father's
footsteps and to die in Japanese hands in 1945. The other the
son of a German Jew who battled against prejudice and the might
of the English Protestant Establishment to become the last
Englishman and the only Jew ever to win the Blue Riband of the
Games -- the 100 metres. Liddell and Abrahams, in 1924 are to
become the two fastest men in the world, yet both have their
own individual driving force. They run because they have to,
Liddell for Gad whose cause he upholds almost to the point of
athletic suicide, and Abrahams as a means of dealing a final
blow to the humiliation and bigotry which have haunted his life.

They both reach Gold, but on their own terms. Riding their
"chariots of Fire" they fight against and finally sweep aside
those newly emerging Goliaths, nationalism and political
expediance, those same monsters which today have resulted in
the probable demise of tne whole magnificent ideal.

Their stories deserve to be told again, if only to inspire
today's young men and women the world over to pick up a new
torch, to rekindle it and to find for themselves that old
Olympic spirit once more.

"CHARIOTS OF FIRE"
FADE UP ON
EXT, FLEET STREET - DAY 1

Filling screen -- BIG CLOSEUP -- a medal, a gold medal --
hanging on a "sky blue" East German chest.

The D.D.R. dirge ploughs on above the image. Then PULL BACK TO
SEE the recipient -- erect -- bland -- smiling a practiced
smile, programmed. CAMERA MOVES BACK FURTHER TO ENCOMPASS his
teammates, second and third -= cast from the same mold, They
stand -- a triumphant, manufactured trio.

CAMERA MOVES BACK AGAIN TO REVEAL they are images on 4 screen
-~ a TV screen. CAMERA MOVES BACK FURTHER «= more screens --
the image multiplied a score or more.

Reflections flash before us -- passing pedestrians -- London
busses, cabs.

The anthem is lost in the sound of traffic as a shop window
emerges, filled with TV screens. London passes them by -- and
their all too-familiar, boring story.

THEN out of the noise of Fleet Street, rises the sound of
singing...a congregation.

"He who would valiant be
'Gainst all disaster.
Let him with constancy
Follow the master..."

The CAMERA PANS LEFT -- SEEKING the singing's source. To the
left of the shop is an alley -- down it we can see an open
church door. Inside the rear of the congregation.

CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE ON them,...erect, sombre suited -- solemn.
MIX TO:

Flying angels vaulting across the screen, gilded and triumphant
amidst the pipes of a great church organ reaching for the sky.
The light is the pale pastel of a Georgian church interior.

THE SOUND OF SINGING CONTINUES,

CONGREGATION

Shall make. him once relent
His first avowed intent
To be a pilgrim.'!

The singing soars, the angels leap. The pipes tremble with
vibrato. The voices are strident -- mainly masculine --
forceful, yet strangely toneless...school-assembly~lilke.

PAN DOWN STILL SEARCHING FOR the source.

CAMERA MOVES DOWN PAST the Organist enthusiastically pounding
his keys with hands and feet alike ~- DOWN PAST the candles
and clean-cut altar silver.

CAMERA LEVELS OFF AT the rosy glow of Anglican priests in the
medals and white regalia of the English established church,

THEN PAN RIGHT PAST the Rabbi with black, flowing beard... THE
RABBI? HERE?

YES. THE RABBI. There's no mistaking his calling, or the cut
of his cloth.

CAMERA ROUNDS PAST the choir of cherubic boys, aged it seems,
from nine to ninety.

CAMERA ROUNDS TO the congregation itself.

They sing determinedly, making a pit of a chore of it, their
"ORDERS OF GERVICE” held bravely before them, On these is
emblazoned "A SERVICE OF THANKSGIVING FOR HAROLD ABRAHAMS
1899-1978."

PAN ALONG the family -- adopted son and daughter -- vary
English, women Harrods shot silked.

Their children, Harold's grandchildren, in prep school spruce.

CAMERA MOVES ONTO his contemporaries, elderly, faded, yet proud
and upright, white~haired and neck-tied to a man with the red
white and blue of the 1924 British Olympic Team,

THEY SING:

CONGREGATION
toinee Lord thou dost defend
Us with thy spirit.

We know we at the end
Shall life inherit.

Then fancies flee away
Ttll fear not what men say,
T'll labor night and day
To be a pilgrim.!

The CAMERA RESTS WITH the rallentando finish.

CAMERA RESTS ON the face of a small, thin gentle man. His cut
is identical to that of the others, yet his eyes are sensitive,

aware, without the self-conscious resolution of those about
him.

He is AUBREY MONTAGUE -- journalist.

THE CONGREGATION SIT in the usual flurry of coughing.

CAMERA PICKS UP a tall elderly aristocrat making his way to the
lectern. He walks with that complete assurance that comes

with being born with a whole canteen of silver cutlery in his
mouth.

This is ANDREW «=~ the sixteenth Earl of Cumbria -- the athlete
Earl.

The coughing ceases as all faces turn obediently up to him --
the Rabbi's included.

There's a moment's majestic silence -- a theatrical pause
before he deigns to speak. He reads from a mammoth bible,
half-moon spectacles hanging from his nose tip.

ANDREW
Let us now praise famous men and
our fathers that begat us,
All these men were honored in
their generations...
The old men remember, misty~eyed.

THE SCUND OVER of rumning feet. Plod, plod, plod...running
through sound, rhythmic, deliberate,

Aubrey Montague's face is uplifted as the thud of the runners
builds with the pounding of many breaths...

CONTINUED CREDITS.

Over Aubrey Montague, young and fit, leading a pack of young
athletes on a training run Oy the sea -- in the depths of a
dull wet summer's day in 1924.

CAMERA LOOKS CLOSELY, RECOGNIZE ‘them, the same features as the
congregation, now young, fresh, hair cupped short. Among
them two or three strangers.

THEY PASS a MAN and BOY walking a dog, who watch them go.

Boy
Who are they Fa?

FATHER
Athletes -- training for the
Olympic Games. See the tall
one -- in the middle!

BOY
Yes. Who is he?

FATHER
That, my boy, is Harold Abrahams
-- The fastest man in England!

CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE ON Harold tall angular, with a glowering
profile, behind him ERIC LIDDELL stocky with freckied open
Celtic features...welve yet to meet him, as we have

HENRY STALLARD rangily taking up the rear, and scarcely out of
breath.

The string threads along the sea's edge leaving a windy,
spattered, chopped path in the smooth wet sand.

CAMERA PICKS UP Aubrey at the front again -~ setting a
eracking pace for such a mild young man. He's happy, healthy,
and delighted to be fit and fast.

HTS VOICE youthful, enthusiastic, rises above.

were like this in 1924.
AUBREY

weeltm most awfully sorry about
your cold and the general
dreariness -- we are also having
quite bad weather here too...

CREDITS END.

And the rain drives down as he trots away, leading his pack
away from us and up the beach towards the hotel perched on
the dunes.

INT, DRAWING ROOM - THE CARLTON HOTEL - DAY 3

The room is high-ceilinged, highly polished and tasteful.
Through the French windows the rain has stopped and a family
are cavorting towards the calming sea. Aubrey sits at the
writing desk by the window. He reads his letter aloud to
himself, quietly. He's aressed in immaculate white Cambridge
cricket sweater and flannels -- his hair brushed and parted --
his shirt collar standing around a silk cravat.

AUBREY

(reading)
'phanks for your letters. I'm
sorry you and Pa are disappointed
that I should be letting the
Olympic Games interfere with my
shorthand but I'm going on with
them just the same. If you
were my age, with a chance to
win the world championship in
Paris, you'd be just as big a
fool as T am. By the way, it's
awfully Kind of Pa to finance
me here in spite of my idiocy.
It's marvelous for esprit de
corps. Most of the chaps have
managed to get down.

The door bursts open. The young ANDREW LINDSEY leans in wits
Stallard and Liddell. .

INT, CARLTON HOTEL BALLROOM - DAY 4

CLOSEUP Aubrey's third finger, wrapped around a solid rubber
ball -- wrist bent, arched -- preparing to impart a
devastating spin.

An indoor cricket game is in session -- enthusiastic -- raucous
-- played with varying degrees of seriousness. Batting is

Eric Liddell ~~ a study in concentration. Behind the wickets,
which stand on a wooden bleck -~ is Andy -- wearing a Panama,

a pair of wicket-keeping gloves and smoking a cigarette in an
elegantly long holder.

To his right at first slip is Harold -- glowering, intense --
hands spread, ready.

Umpiring at Aubrey's bowler's end is Henry Stallard -- .
festooned with sweaters and several hats. Other team members
are in "the field."

Aubrey -- gripping the ball menacingly -- trots up to bowl.
Through the air the ball arches, buzzing like a wasp. Liddell
plays stolidly forward -~ the ball spins off the floor, clips
his bat my a merest edge and thumps into Harold's hands.

Harold leaps for the ceiling with a yell, and reaches for the
bat.

HAROLD
Howizzeeeee???

HENRY
{resoundingly ;
eyes to the roof)

HAROLD
(purpling)
What d'you mean, not out? You
could hear it in bloody Bournemouth.
Come on Liddell, my innings.

ERIC
(pulling the dat
away and solemniy
winkinr at Andy)
Did I touch i.? Was it the crack
of my wrist } 2u heard?

HAROLD
(apoplectic)
T saw the bloody thing BEND! Andy?

Andy studies Harold's apoplexy with amused tolerance. The
cigarette holder perched in his immensely gloved hand. The
surrounding fielders smile. Eric retains an expression of
complete innocence.

It's not PAIRI

His last appeal is to the bowler ~- but he's wasting his time
-- for Aubrey is convuised in uncontrollable laughter, Then
they all break, Including Eric.

AUBREY
(voice over)
Harold's here -- as intense as
ever...just as he was when I
first set eyes on him.

CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE ON Aubrey's laughing face.
THEN SLOW MIX INTO clouds of locomotive steam,
EXT, CAMBRIDGE STATION PLATFORM - 1919 - DAY 5

TITLE: September 1919.
STEAM, steam, steam.

The station sign "Cambridge" emerges and INTO SHOT walks Aubrey
~-- visibly more gauche,..four years younger. He's loaded with
luggage, tennis racquets, golf clubs, etc. -~- and he's anxious.

OVER this hear Harold's voice -~ loaded with sarcasm.

HAROLD
(voice over)
Sorry to inconvenience you, sir!
Damned inconsiderate of us, all
arriving on the same train. of
course you're short of porters.
Anyone would imagine it's the
first day of the blasted term.

The Freshmen of 1919 are descending off the train. This
generation, the first after the Great War -- has its own
special poignancy. There's 4 bustle of luggage -- 4 slamming
of doors.

Aubrey struggles past Harold, who just "played hell" with the
station master.

Harold picks up his bag and catches Aubrey up.

HAROLD
Need some help?

AUBREY

HAROLD

clubs for a start.

He throws the clubs over his shoulder puts the racquets under

his one arm and picks up a suitcase with the other,

HAROLD
All set?

AUBREY
It's jolly kind. Are you sure
you're all right?

HAROLD
Fine.

AUBREY
Thanks -- thanks awfully.

They start off down the platform -- both loaded up -- Aubrey

with bags and cricket bat.

; HAROLD
Quite a sportsman, eh?

AUBREY
'Beg Pardon!...Oh -- all the clubs
and things? All show really --
though I do enjoy it. I take it
you're not keen?

_ HAROLD
I run.
AUBREY

HAROLD
I don't know. I've never lost!

Aubrey looks at him as they pass through the ticket barrier --
the collector plucking their tickets from their top pockets.
A voice cuts in,

VETERAN
Carry your bags sir? Find you
a cab?

HAROLD

Nol No th...!

He turns and looks into the eyes of a young man of about
twenty-five, shabbily dressed but wearing his war medals.
One sleeve hangs empty at his side. Beside him, holding
his other arm, is another man of the same age, with medals,
but with no sight. Aubrey looks at Harold.

HAROLD
Oh! Er -- yes -- thanks.

He hesitates, not knowing what to unload and where.

VETERAN
(eagerly )
Right sir -- Thank you sir --
Here y'are Bill -- grab hold
of these.

He takes a case off each of them and puts them in the
blind man's grip. Then he takes the rest -- clubs etc.
himself. .

VETERAN
Where to sir -- which college?
HAROLD
Gonville and Caius...
VETERAN

He leads them through the mob whistling. The Blind Man
follows right behind him uncannily following the sound.

EXT. CAMBRIDGE STATION APPROACH - DAY 6

The Veteran leads them to a cab -- opens the door -- and tells
the driver the destination as he loads up the luggage beside .
him.

VETERAN
All stowed sir.

HAROLD
Thank you -~- Thanks very much.

He gives the man a florin.
Aubrey presses the sam into the Blind Man's hand.

AUBREY
Yes -- thank you...and good luck.

* BLIND MAN
Thanks mate -- all the best!

And he grabs Aubrey's hand and shakes it. Aubrey is visibly
moved. He climbs into the cab and slams the door.

INT. TAXI CAB - DAY 7
They are both sitting in silence. Then:

HAROLD

on his florin and puts it in his breast pocket.

VETERAN
Mine was Yid Harry. That's what
we fought the bloody war for.
To give all the Jew boys a
proper education.

The Blind Man reacts -- showing his contempt.
EXT. STREETS OF CAMBRIDGE - DAY 8

From high -- Looking down at the cab motoring through the
spires and towers of the ancient town ~- across the bridzes,
greens and through the droves of eyclists. The clocks chime
and the trees stand serene against the autumn mist and all
is peace and tranquility.

EXT. CAIUS COLLEGE - DAY 9

UP ON the carved coat of arms over the arched entrance.
Harold is looking up at them as Aubrey pays the cab. it
pulls away as they pick up the luggage... They walk through
the arch into the inner quadrangle of lawn surrounded by

medieval arches. This is the college court. They stop and
stare.

There is an immediate peace and breathless serenity here.
Centuries of stillness yards from the busy street. They
gaze about them as the sound of organ music rises from the
chapel.

Harold looks up at the spires -- at the stone crosses -~ ali

the symbols of English stability, continuity -- permanence
-- establishment.

AUBREY
Penny for them?

HAROLD
Thinking about my parents that's
ali.

AUBREY
(looking)
Yes. One does, doesn't one.

A VOICE CUTS IN.

They turn sharply. The door to the Porter's lodge is open to
their right. They drop the luggage and go in.

INT. CAIUS COLLEGE - GREAT HALL - NIGHT le

CUT TO a sepia still of the Freshers of 1913 -- equally young
-- if anything more stiffly self-conscious.

PAN ALONG the faces. The lost generation.
As we do so the voices of the CHAPEL CHOIR singing grace inLatin.
The picture hanging on the Great Hall wall -- lit by candlelight.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL Harold standing, the picture behind him.
His head bowed.

PAN RIGHT PAST Aubrey then UP and AROUND TO a list of
Whe Fallen" emblazoned on the wall above the top table.

MIX SOUND to MASTER'S VOICE.
Run down the list as the Master speaks: ~

MASTER
(voice over)

T take the War List and I run
down it. Here is name after name
which I cannot read and which we
who are older cannot hear without
emotion -- names which are only
names to you, the new college, but
which to us, who knew the men,
bring up one after another...

The Master is addressing "The Freshers" dinner. A sumptuous
candlelit occasion in the ancient timber-roofed college hail.
He's glancing back at the memorial tablet behind him.

MASTER
(voice over)
...pictures of honesty and manly
beauty and goodness and zeal and
vigour and intellectual promise.

PAN ALONG the young faces before him -- fresh, clean, polished
in stiff white shirts and black ties -- listening.

MASTER
(voice over)
It is the flower of a generation,
the glory of Israel, the pick of
England, and they died to save
England and all that England
stands for.

He pauses for a moment to collect himself, His young audience
bow their heads. His fellow tutors hide their emccion. Herold
and Harry catch each other's eye across the tabdie.

12 Cont.

Harry half-smiles reassuringly. Harold's gaze shifts to Any
who's sitting erect in complete but respectful control. As the
Master continues, dwell on each of our characters, for what re
says has its own peculiar relevance to each.

TO Andy -- ultra-privileged -- astronomically wealthy. The
elder son of the Duke of Cumbria. His is the choice between

dissolute waste, or responsible deployment of his immense
advantages, .

TO Harry -- Son of a Yorkshire banker -~ hard-~headed but
compassionate. He's chosen medicine as the ideal medium in
which to exploit both traits. Great sense of responsibility
towards those who worked to put him here.

TO Aubrey «= Gentle son of gentle Southern English middle-
class parents, Adzr’cmer with a vaguely romantic vision of
what he wants for himself -- to write a powerful novel? To

be a hard-nosed but compassionate journalist? He listens with
more than a trace of emotion,

And TO Harold -- Jewish money-lender's son from Golders Green.
First generation German, conscious of his Jewishness and feels
a desperate need to carve a niche for himself in the
establishment of his father's adopted country. Hets defensive,
ruthlessly ambitious, yet intrinsically kind.

Over all this the Master CONTINUES:

MASTER
And to you gentlemen, the new
generation, have been bequeathed
the hopes and dreams of those who
went before you. Through tragic
necessity their aspirations have
become yours. You are doubly
privileged. On their benalf I
exhalt you to examine yourselves,
assess your true potential, seek
to discover where your true chance
of greatness lies, Without their
supreme sacrifice such opportunities
would not have been yours. For
their sakes, for your parents, for
the sake of your college and your
country, seize your chance, rejoice
in it and let no power nor persuasion
deter you from your task.

INT, STUDENTS! ROOM - CATUS COLLEGE 13

From the stone landing we can see into Aubrey's room. He is
seated at a small writing desk lit by a tiny reading lamp.
His dinner jacket hangs on his chair and his bow tie hangs
loosely round his neck. A coal fire burns red in the
fireplace -- the place is cosy if frugal. He is writing 1:

inevitable letter to his mother. As he writes a low murmur
rises in his ears -- half-chant, haif-song. He lifts his eyes
from his letter and listens...puzzled.

Then he rises and quietly crosses his room to the open door.
Across the tiny landing Harold's door is ajar.
Aubrey tiptoes to it and peeps in.

Harold is standing, book in hand before his smal] table,
rocking to and fro as he reads...donning various articles of
ceremonial as he does so. He is at prayer. For a moment
Aubrey watches, deeply impressed. Then he moves back, into
his room, sits and picks up his pen.

AUBREY
(as he writes) .
Today I made the acquaintance of
a pretty remarkable chap!

INT, COLLEGE GREAT HALL - DAY 14

It's the Students Societies Fair or 'Squash" as it's called.
ALL the various clubs and societies set up stalls and ply for
new members from the thronging Freshers. It's bedlam. club
Secretaries and Presidents are barking out the praises of their
own pursuits.

Harold, Aubrey and Harry are on parade. Harold is looking at
Aubrey's collection of memberships.

HAROLD
Cricket Club, Golfing Society,
Tennis. Squash Club, Flora and
Fauna, and Philately. Is that
all? You're idle man, idlel

AUBREY
I can't join everything, I've

A chorus of Gilbert and Sullivan strikes up somewhere ~- on 4
gramophone. Harold immediately cocks an ear,

HARRY
What about bird watching? Take
a book along with you.

AUBREY
How can I watch if I'm reading
a book?
Suddenly Harold breaks spontaneously into song:

'Welre soldiers of the Queen,
All linked in friendly tether.
Upon the battle scene,

The other two look at each other as Harold pushes his way
towards the source of the music -- then they follow,

AT THE GILBERT AND SULLIVAN SOCIETY STALL -- a gramophone horn
is blowing out the Dragoons chorus from "Patience," “The
SECRETARY and PRESIDENT sre singing lustily bass and tenor.
Harold arrives and without a word slips into the baritone heads
together.

TRIO
'Wetre every mother's son,
Prepared to fight and fail is
the enemy of one, the enemy of all is!’

They cheer and shake hands as they finish with a flourish.
Harry and Aubrey applaud.

Desperately short of tenors,

It's an ache, a helplessness,

and anger...one Feels numiliated.
Sometimes I say to myself -- hey.
Steady on! You're imagining all
this! And then I catch that
look again, catch it on the edge
of a remark -- feel a cold
reluctance in a handshake.

He takes a sip of cocoa. Aubrey follows suit.

HAROLD

My father -~ he's a German Jew.
He is alien.

(smiles }
Spiritually, culturally,
linguistically, and gastronomically
he's as foreign as a frankfurter --
and a kosher one at that.

Aubrey laughs.

HAROLD
I love and admire him. He worships
this country. From nothing he
built what he believed was enough
to make true Englishmen of his sons.
My brother's a doctor -- a leader
in his field. He wanted for
nothing. And here am I setting
up shop in the finest university

in the land.

EXT. 4 BRIDGE OVER THE CAM - DAY 16
Harold and Aubrey are strolling over a bridge -- their arms

full of books. Their conversation continues.

HAROLD
But the old man forgot one thing.
This England of his is Christian,
and Anglo Saxon...and so are her
halls of intellect, her corridors
of power. And those who walk them
guard them, with jealousy and venom.

They WALK INTO VIEW -- amid flying buttresses and towering
Gothic stone.

: HAROLD

Strangely enough, I've never
consciously felt Jewish. Not
even at school. And there they
treated me like some rare species
of ape. But this place -- look
at it. Every stone reeks of
Anglican pomp and complacency.
It's enough to deconvert St. Paul.
I want to stand, and cry out, and
bring the whole damn place tumbling
down,

Harold stops.

AUBREY
Well go on! Go on -- be a devil!

Harold looks at him. They're outside King's College Chapel,
the Great Rose window above them. He closes his eyes,
raises his arms wo to it, and lets out a long mournful chant
in Hebrew. People stop and stare. When he's finished he
calmly walks on.

AUBREY
Feel better?

HAROLD
Not really! = prefer Gilbert

They walk.

AUBREY
So what now? Grin and bear it?

I'm going to take them on. One

EXT. TRINITY COLLEGE COURT - CLOSEUP THE FACE 18
OF TRINITY CLOCK - MIDDAY

It says 11:50. PAN DOWN TO REVEAL the great square of Lawn
surrounded by cloisters and above them students! rooms with
mullioned windows opening out onto the court itself. In

the windows undergrads sit peering cut expectantly. Below

them the square is beginning to fill with excited crowds of
students.

Like most aspects of University life there is a studied
casuainess about the whole affair. It must appear to be
happening almost by accident -- tradition is everybody's
guide -- no organization or presentation is needed -- all
Slots into place as if by magic.

Harold appears clad in an overcoat over his running kit. A
scarf flying nonchalantly around his neck, He's accompanied
by Harry and Aubrey, plus Robin, very much in his official
capacity. They push their way across the square to a position
uncer the clock, There's a smattering of applause and a

swell of half cheers/half jeers. Cheers for the courage of
the man and jeers for his downright affrontery.

The mob gather around the quartet as Robin raises his hands
in a plea for silence. The crowd hush.

ROBIN
Right chaps -- Thank you -- please.
(clears his throat)
Let it be known that H.M. Abrahams
of Gonville and Caius has formerly
made challenge for the Trinity
Court Dash.

Again the jeers/cheers.

ROBIN
For those present who are not
familiar with the rvles they are
as follows: -- The Challenger
will attempt to run around the
perimeter of the court, to and
from a fixed point beneath the
clock, within the time taken by
the sound clock to strike midday.
The distance to be covereé is
traditionally recognized as one
of three hundred and twelve paces.

There's a stir of amazement in the crowd...and a smatter of
applause again

FIRST STUDENT
(shouting)
What have you got on your feet,
Abrahams? Rockets?
Cont.
There's laughter at this, «hich Robin again quells. He loc=
up at the clock. It says five minutes to go.

ROBIN
The challenge will commence on
the strike of one. The challenger
must reach his mark before the
strike of twelve,

Comments are thrown in as he speaks, from the surrounding
crowd:

CROWD
‘What. on? A motor bike?!
'Go home Abrahams. You're wasting
your time,'
tYou show 'em, Harold!'
1Go to it, Caiusi!
'Do it for Israell' etc...

With patronizing laughter -~ and sarcastic applause.

ROBIN

(pleughing on)
May I also remind those of you
who are new to this college and
its peculiarities.

(points to the clock)
The Trinity clock is unique. It
strikes not one, but two-fold
for eaeh hour.

There's a murmur of renewed interest at this. At least it
puts the feat within the tounds cf possibility.

ROBIN
Would the challenger please make
himself ready!

EXT. TRINITY COURT - MIDDAY 20

Harold has disrobed and is ready. Robin glances up at the
elock. It's one minute to twelve.

across the pavement.

crowd crane their necks as Harold toes the line to find the
best grip.

ROBIN
(addressing the throng)
Owing to the absence of any other
challenger, Mr. Abrahams will
run alone.

A VOICE cuts IN.

VOICE
Not so Mr. Starter!

All heads turn -- to see, hurrying through the crowd, his

coat thrown over his shoulders, ANDY LINDSEY. Crooked in his
arm is an unopened bottle of champagne. Harold is as amazed
as the rest. Andy tosses his coat to the open-mouthed Aubrey

and the bottle to Harry. He's resplendent in Eton running
strip.

ROBIN
Your name and college if you
please sir.

ANDY

Harold hits the second corner two yards up but is in need of
a breather. So he eases out to allow Andy to take him on the
inside. An enormous roar greets this. Andy stretches his
long legs down the southern side and the Master of Trinity's
eyes flash with delight.

DONG! DONGI ~~ DONG! DONG!

The third bend. Both men are gasping now as they clatter and

slide into the last of the long straights, the eastern edge
of the court.

DONG! DONG!

Eleven strikes left! Andy fights to keep his lead, but the
jutting jaw of Abrahams inches past him, and there's a yard
between them as they near the final corner.

DONG! DONG! -- DONG! DONG!

The crowd spill across the court in the sudden realization
that the challenge is definitely on.

DONG! DONG! =~ DONG! DONG!
Skidding around the final bend Andy has virtually nothing
left -- but Harold, driven by his desperate need to succeed,
pumps on and finds a devastating finishing burst from God knows
where,

"Nineteen! Twenty! Twenty-Onel"

The crowd chant out the count as Harold fights towards the
Line.

"Tyenty-Two! Twenty-Three!"

And he flings himself across the finish and into the waiting
arms of Harry and Aubrey. .

DONG! and he's DONE [Tl

Pipes skirl and Highland Dancers, arms flung high, tiptoe
their crossed lain swords. One, a young boy, one a young girl.
They dance on a raised platform in a grassy natural arena :
somewhere in the Scottish Highlands. It's a Highland
Gathering, a folk festival of music, dance, and physical
prowess.

Through those pointing toes -~ across the arena, against the
peering faces of out-for-the-day families, see a race on the

point of starting. Runners lined, expectant, awaiting the
starter's call.

Nervously they toe the line -- faces peer and crane on necks
of parents, brothers, sisters. The dancers dance to the

highland hills shimmer blue behind.

There's a spatter of applause as the winner wins and the crowds
break and drift in a kaleidoscope of burnt browns and tartan.

CAMERA MOVES IN ON THE CROWD.

Eric is surrounded by children all seeking his autograph. He's
happily signing, chatting to each kid amongst the forest of

FADE UP ON
EXT, THE RIVER BANK - CAMBRIDGE - EVENING 35
It's a summer evening in June, 1923 -- the exams are over and

nothing remains except to pass the remaining days on the river.
PASSING DOWN the “Backs” SEE everywhere boats containing
parties of men and girls laughing and smoking, some moored

to the banks, some idly drifting with the stream, and all
carrying Chinese lanterns which bathe the river in a soft
pleasan= light. The trees, in full leaf, sweep the waters,

the air, heavy with warmth and insects, lies breathiess
beneath the fast descending dark. It is a scene of harmony,
peace and absolute bliss.

CAMERA PANS ALONG the bank -- ERRATICALLY -- the idyllic scene
below. The boating parties look up and wave and laugh with
delight. +raw-boatered puntsmen cup their hands and shout --
their words drifting away with the waters.

THR SOUND of breath -- regular -- even, rises -- as does the
plod of fest...plod, plod, piod, plod. More waves ~- more
comments ~- more laughter.

ANGLE DOWN RIVER SLIGHTLY 35-A

Andy is reclining back on a cushion of girlish breasts...He's
in his element -- champagne in hand, debs in attendance
trailing daintily fingered ripples in the currents of his
hair. They laugh and nuzzle beneath the warm lantern night.
Punting them up stream smoothly, expertly and, in the
circumstances, very generously, is Aubrey -- himself lost in
the tranquility of the time, the place, and the setting.

THEN the cheers lift from up river -- the laughter -- the
jibes. Aubrey jolts out of his reverie and peers for the
source of merriment. He smiles and chuckles.

disbelief and awe.

Wait here son. Assimilate the

Eric examines the rare breed cavorting in front of him. This
wag his description. See it in pictures.

"mhig was the first time in my life I'd ever seen a cinder
track let alone a pro runner. They danced about on their

toes as if they were stepping on hot bricks, and whenever they
started to run they dug big holes for their toes to go into
for the time when those toes would dance no more. Surely

they did not expect me to make such a fool of myself as that?"

it and shakes it warmly.

He winks at them and they nod -- understanding.

SAM
Right Mr. Liddell -- we'll see
you at the tape.

And Sandy and he stride off down the track. PETE and HUGHIE
lead Eric to the start. There, either side of him, they set
about getting down to their marks in that mannered -- balletic
-- conceited manner 50 familiar to us today. But to the
unsophisticated Liddell

Eric drops to his marks without a fuss and awaits Sam who's
taken out a pistol.

raw, is a yard behind in five and immediately his two opponent
close the gap in front of him -- almost spiking him in the

process. He cheeks in astonishment, then, setting his jaw

abruptly -- short -- and turns pleased. He's met face to face
by Sam.

SAM .
Mr. Liddell, if you want to pull
a hamstring you're going the best
way about it. Run on lad, run
on -- ease yourself to a trot.

And he leaves them, crossing to where his overcoat is hanging
on the finishing post. He fishes out another cigar and lights
up. Sandy brings Eric over to him.

SANDY
Well Sam? Can you help us?

Sam draws on his cigar and exhales gratefully before answering.

SAM
No Mr. McGrath. TIT don't think
I can.

Sandy looks at him -- then at Eric -- they're both bewildered.

French Battle hymn rolls on as we dip into the occasion.

and lift their gaze up to the delightful creature above them.

who do speak do so in hushed and reverent tones -- not
wishing to jangle tightly drawn nerves.

Harold is still fully dressed -- carefully unpacking his
meticulously arranged attache case. His running vest --

shorts <= towel. Spiked shoes, highly polished, a cork on

each spike. His shining trowel for digging his starting holes.
His ericket-style sweater and college blazer...His pottle of
rub. Aubrey is next to him,..He looks towards him -- obviously
dying to speak to him -- he opens his mouth but the hand of

Harold, his Master at Caius, and our old friend the Master at
Trinity are settled into deep-winged arm chairs before a richly
Jaden log fire. They wear black ties for the dinner being
cleared silently by a man servant behind them. The casements
of this lovely, lived-in room, 4s prown and comforting as an
old tobacco pouch, are open to sound of evening laugaver

rising from the cpurt below. ‘The May twilight easts an
approving gaze on the scene of mature, civilized, if ultra
conservative contentment.

The Caius Master reminisces through his wine -- theatrically
_w almost as a prologue -~ setting the scene.

CAIUS
Laid this down in 1914, on the
day they deciared the war, in a

Harold looks at the two old Dons. He envies their

The Caius Master tops up Trinity's glass and then his own,
leaving Harold to stew for a moment. Harold waits, Trinity

sits back and looks up at the flickering shadgqws on the
ceiling.

TRINITY
We at Cambridge have long been
proud of our athletic prowess.
We believe, have always believed,
that our games are indispensible.
They help mould the complete
Englishman. They create character,
foster courage, honesty and
leadership. But most of all imbue
him with an unassailable spirit of x
loyalty, comradership and mutual
responsibility...Would you agree?

HAROLD
(still carefully)
Yes sir -- I would.

He waits, foreing Trinity to go on.

TRINITY
Abrahams. I'm afraid there is 4
growing suspicion in the bosom
of the University -- and I tell
you this without in any way
decrying your achievements in
which we all rejoice -- that,
in your enthusiasm to, succeed,
you have, perhaps, lost sight
of the latter.

There's a silence. Harold looks at him, then at Caius. They
look back, suddenly cold-eyed. Harold feels his neck hair

rise in a surge of anger. He holds back and answers them,
quietly, deliberately,

HAROLD
May I ask what form this disloyalty,
this betrayal, takes?

TRINITY
Oh! Hardly betrayal.

HAROLD
The word grief was mentioned.

There's a pause, and the baton passes to Caius.

suggest, of individual glory. A

T am a Cambridge man first and

what I intend to achieve, is for
my family, my University, and my

HAROLD
At all costs nol But I do aim
to win within the rules. Perhaps,

There's a pause. Then Caius leans forward confidentially --
in a gesture of conciliation.

CALUS
My boy! Your approach has been,
shall we say, 2 little too
artisan? You are the elite, and,
as such, must be seen to rum rather
to the manner born.

Harold looks at them -- pertrified in a py-gone age. He
puts down his port and stands. He extends his hand to Caius.

The beautiful hanging purity of the voices of the King's
College Chapel Choir...singing in German...in praise of the
God of our Dons, of Cambridge, of England and St. George.

The slender, perpendicular chapel reaches its frail stone
fingered arches heavenwards, above the heads of a breathless
nave. Here are seated, in solemn listening rows, those whose
pilgrimage to this ancient city reaches fulfilment here.
Amongst them sits Harold ~~ listening -- his ‘houghts
floating on the ether of the clear, sweet sound. Beside him
sits his MOTHER -.~ a small, slender lady with intense black
eyes and the high boned, aristocratic facial architecture of
the mid European. Neither speaks. Harold's eyes close at
the Choir's bidding. His Mother's roam the scale and
magnificence of this Christian chapel about her...wondering
even fearing, at its power and influence. Her gaze shifts

to her son -- chin held high beside her. She looks at him «+
at what he has become -- and here -- in this awesome place --
begins to understand.

intelligence which augers 411 for all who challenge nim.

BIRKENHEAD
Seriously though, gentlemen.
You are the favoured few -- you
constitute what is without doubt
the most powerful athletic force
ever to leave these shores. You
are to face the world's pest,
brown and yellow, white and black,
all young and ardent as yourselves,
fleet of foot and strong of limb,
from every civilized nation on
the face of the earth. I am in no
doubt whatsoever you will acquit
yourselves honourably and with
distinction. Good luck to you

Andy draws up in his Bentley -- the Chauffeur unloading a
mountain of luggage. Aubrey and Henry look proud, nervous,
unused to such fuss, attention. Eric is standing quietly,

alone, in the crowd, as only he can. There's no sign of
Harold.

BIRKENHEAD
Yes! The Americans have prepared
themselves specially, some might
say too specially, to gain success.
But we feel we may, in our own
unsophisticated way, have their
match...Yes they do have a number
of men who rank as world beaters...
put this contest is in Europe and
not the rarefied climes of the
United States. Parisian conditions
are bound to be more robust, more
combative and certainly more
cavalier. And in Abrahams, Liddell
and Lindsey we have the mem to give
them a run for their money.

men in Britain turn to face him. Seated behind a massive
writing desk.,.leaning back into the deep leather chair, clad
in a dinner jacket and smoking a cigarette in a mist of smoke,
is the PRINCE OF WALES. Seated in a winged armchair to his
right is the EARL OF CADOGAN, the Chairman of the

British Olympic Association...a formidable bald character with
a heavy waxed moustache, ‘Standing with his back to the
fireplace is His Grace the DUKE OF SUTHERLAND and the
President of the Association -- a spindly figure with that high
forehead, thin hair and florid countenance of the inbred
English aristocracy.

Rising from an armchair to his left is Birkenhead, his hand
extended to Eric as he crosses to meet him.

Ah. Liddell my dear chap. Just

Paddock leaping wildly for second...Abrahams a despairing

gentlemanly Scholtz.

EXT, CAFE - DAY oT

Sam is sitting in the sun -- enjoying his breakfast. Open
before him is @ French Sunday newspaper. Bells sound from
nearby churches. Families pass by to Mass.

In the paper the headline:

"te 200 meters. Un triumphe pour les Etats-Unis!"

The Waiter arrives with more coffee. He sees the paper. He
throws his eyes up into his head in exaggerated wonder.

"reg Americaines!" he pouts, and makes a "vroom" of speed.
Sam smiles and nods -- waits for the Waiter to leave --

then carefully begins to tear the picture of the finish from
the page.

EXT. THE ARENA - DAY 98

On to the track, flushed with success, come the American
speedmen -- Scholtz, Paddock and Co. -- in their immaculate
track suits. The fast men of other nations mingle with them
in various modes of attire...Harold appears in long towelling
dressing gown and heavy leather shoes. He carries his spikes
under his arm. He exchanges greetings with the Yanks.
Porritt the Kiwl is there too.

Around the track -- jogging -- warming up -- is Aubrey --

nervous -- on edge. For this is his great day. The final
of the 3000 metre steeplechase. As he jogs he passes the

obstacies he is to face -- eyeing them -- the water jump,

the high hard barriers -- testing them critically.

EXT. THE SCOTTISH CHURCH - PARIS - DAY 99

A very sober congregation is pouring into the Scottish Church

u.« Paddock is ready and is away with it -- Abrahams --
conned -- dwells, and is left a startled yard adrift. He
fights back, but can't catch the big American, who maintains
the three-foot margin to the tape.

Charlie turns and grins at Harold, who's furious with

himself. The American puts his arm paternally around Harold's
shoulders. ,

cur TO SILENCE:
INT, SAM'S ROOM - DAY 107

It is breathlessly still -- save for the distant, tinny throt
of the band, way over in the arena -- and the swish of Sam's
olled hands as they sweep hard and deep over Harold's prone
pody. He is lying face-down on the massage table -- eyes
closed. Sam, silent, leans into his task reverently.
There's an almost religious dedication to his labours -- 4
sanctum-like atmosphere in the room. Then, Harold opens his
eyes and looks across at the wall. Pinned on it is the torn
out picture of the 200 metres finish. Scholtz first, then
Paddock...and himself fifth. He dwells on it for a moment.
Above him Sam notices the direction of his gaze. He says
nothing -- just rubs.

Harold sighs 'neath Sam's hands -- then, raising his head,
turns to look the other way and lowers it again. Through
the gloom he sees a figure seated, almost unnoticed, in the
corner, as if ashamed to be there. It's Aubrey. He's in
shadow, invited in to hear a final confession from the
turbulent Harold.

SWISH! SWISH! Goes Sam. "Da de da da" goes the distant
band. Then Harold begins to speak, slowly, deliberately,
quietly. ;

HAROLD
Remember when we first met, old
man? You were like old Toady,
loaded up with all your
paraphernalia...bewildered,
tottering round, like some funny
wind-up toy. We shared a taxi,
remember? You made me feel an
age old, burdened, sour...even
superior. Hal That was the
miscalculation of my life. You,
Aubrey, are my most complete man.

Sam glances over at Aubrey and smiles.

Aubrey, I've known the fear of losing...
but now, I'm almost too frightened

And, as Sam massages on, unspeaking, Aubrey just sits,
unwilling and unable to reply.

EXT, THE STADE COLOMBES - DAY 108
"Pinal day" for the six flyers. The stadium is agog with
expectancy -- all the dignitaries are there -- as on opening

day. This is the race they all want to see.

The band is playing in the centre of the arene -- this time

an American Marine band in honour of their four finalists --
Paddock, Scholtz -- Bowman -~- and Murchison. A medley of
pacey, bouncy American tunes adds spice to the already charged
atmosphere.

The Prince of Wales is parading down in the arena with other
British officials. Birkenhead included. It's our chance to
see the primitive field events in progress ~~ particularly
the pole vault, rope climbing, and tossing the weight over
the bar. Up in the stands Eric is taking his seat with Clare,
with them are Jo and Sandy. Sandy is looking morose,
frustrated. There's a cheer as an American high jumper clears
the bar for victory.

INT, DRESSING ROOM - DAY 109

Silence. The atmosphere is beyond tense it's rigid. The

six men, the sixth being Porritt the New Zealander, are
quietly changing, not daring to look each other in the eye.
Even the Americans don't communicate between themselves. Tt's
the time for concentration -- for the gathering up of ail ,
their emotional and intellectual capacities into one explosive
force. From the arena above comes the strains of "The Star
Spangled Banner." They barely notice. Harold is just
peginning to undress -- shedding his jacket and tie. He
places his leather attache case precisely before him and flick
open the catches. He lifts the lid.

Lying on the top of his neatly packed kit is a Letter. Out
of it falls a small gold chain and Arab charm -- with an
inscription from the Koran cut out in it. Harold opens the
Letter and reads:

Harold folds up the letter -- and looks at the charm, Then
he smiles and hangs it round his neck.

EXT, THE ARENA - DAY . 110

The band strikes up a triumphant march and the six competitors
enter the arena in line -~ to roars of applause from the crowd.
The four Americans lead -- then Abrahams, Looking incongruous
in his long dressing gown and shoes -- carrying his spikes in
his hand -- and finally Porritt in an Oxford sweater and 2
collar turned up black Kiwi biazer. They all carry trowels.
They reach the starting line and break formation. They begin

Cover it as you will but here are the details:

Dr. Moir the British starter gets them off to a magnificent
start. At twenty-five meters they are all together, but at
fifty meters Abrahams is clear of Scholtz and Bowman. He
holds his Lead to dip into the tape winning by two fest.

Scholtz is second and Porritt, with a late burst, third.
Paddock is a disappointing fifth.

It's all over in ten seconds. Harold has won.

As its strains float on the evening air up into Sam's room --

there rigidly to attention. WATCH his face as the anthem runs

his hat and punches his fist right through it.

INT. THE DRESSING ROOM - DAY 114

In direct contrast to the silence before the race the room is
alive with laughter and popping corks. It's packed with the
British team and officials -- The Yanks are sportingly
joining in the celebrations -- Paddock especially.

Harold is quietly packing his case, strangely subdued as the
roistering goes on around him. He finishes and closes it
with his usual neat precision. He looks about him, tnen,
surprisingly, he turns, takes his hat from the hook and pushes
his way out through the door. Andy and Aubrey see him go.

EXT. THE STADE COLOMBES - EVENING 118

The last day of competition and the stadium is beginning to
look a little tired -- a bit care-worn -- the novelty has
worn off. It's the end of a long day and a long week.
Souvenir sellers are closing up shop. Litter collectors
sweep up piles of rubbish. A news vendor yawns at his stand,
his’ placard says "Olympics. Last Day. American Scholtz wins
200 metres" in journalese French.

People are leaving. A decathlon high jump is being fought
out in the arena, at ridiculously low heights.

In the press box -~ press men are phoning in their last reports
-- bidding farewell to their colleagues -- packing up their
typewriters. Ice cream and drinks salesmen are handing in
their trays -- counting up their takings. It's one big wind
down, a turn off for another four years.

THEN the Pipes and the Band of The Queen's Own Cameron
Highlanders suddenly strike up and march in full splendor
into the center of the arena.

Immediately the place comes to life again. People departing,
stop in their tracks, then turn back to catch the new
excitement. Press men cease their farewelis, set down phones
and take notice.

The arrival of the Prince of Wales in the Presidential Box
causes fresh excitement and a buzz of anticipation settles on
the arena.

"SCOTLAND THE BRAVE" is the clarion call from the pipes 4
from the competitors’ tunnel come the 400 meter finalists i
by Eric Liddell.

Following him are:

J. Imbach Switzerland

The crowd start to clap rhythmically to the beat of the tune
as the competitors march to their starting point. Again

the Americans, only, wear track suits...the rest are in
blazers or sweaters and slacks. Eric is in the latter --

the Edinburgh University crest on his chest. UP in the stand
-~- behind the Prince and the full British Olympic Committee
-- git their whole track and field team...come to pay tribute
to the man they hold most dearly in their affection. With
them Sandy, Clare and Jo. Sandy has two empty seats beside
him -- he's looking anxiously at the entrance. The race is
run on two bends only -- there being an exceptionally long
back straight.

The men dig in their starting positions -- staggered of course
~- Eric being on the outside. When he's satisfied tric turns
his attention to his opponents. He shakes them each by the
hand as is his custom.

ERIC
(seemingly completely
without nerves)
Have a good race everybody.
Remember, I don't expect to
see you again ~- 'til after the
race.

And he laughs and goes off up the track to take up a starting
position on the outside lane.

The Americans are bemused. Taylor turns to his Coach whois
helping him with‘his starting position.

TAYLOR
That guy Liddell, is he a problem?

COACH
No problem -~ he's a flyer --
he's had two races today already
..-He'll die...just swing along
you guys and wait. After 300
metres rigor mortis sets in.
You'll pull him in on a rope.

The Coach moves away to his other runners. Jackson Schoits
appears, watching him go.

hell to beat.

And he goes off up the track leaving Taylor to ponder on his
words.

The Starter calls them to order...Eric starts to peel off
his clothes. Behind him we see the figure in U.S. track suit
trotting up the track towards him. It's Jackson Scholtz.

He reaches Eric and silently, without a word, presses a note
into his hand. Eric watches him trot away before he opens
it. He reads.

"tn the Old Book it says ‘He that
honours me, I will honour.’

Good luck!

Jackson Scholtz."

Eric, visibly moved, looks after the fast retreating figure.

STARTER
Ready gentlemen |

Eric clasps the note in his hand, tight, and turns his whole
attention to the race.

The loudspeaker calls for silence. A more than usually tenses
hush settles over the stadium. See the PIPERS -- standing,
still, watching.

STARTER
To your marks...set...BANG!

Eric and Butler, the second string Briton, go off Liss tne
wind leading by ten yards at the first bend. Taylor and
Fitch quickly overtake Imbach and Johnson and the rac® is on
between the remaining four. The Americans, obeying _
instructions, cruise steadily behind and sure enoug", Suter
begins to tire...Blowing, he "ties up" and the two Yanks pess
him without effort. The American Coach is watching witn

But Eric, on hitting the final bend, throws the famous "heed"
right back and huris himself up the final straight. Taylor
and Fitch, realizing he's not slowing, attempt to pick up

but can make no impression. Indeed Taylor's legs give way
and he falls ten yards from the line as Eric sweeps through
to a magnificent victory in the world time of 47, 3/5 seconds.

Again the wild scenes of jubilation -- but this time the
French crowd join in with affectionate and generous applause.
Eric trots back to help Taylor to his feet. Taylor shakes his
hand warmly and then limps over the line. x

His teammates tumble on to the track to pick him up shoulder
high and carry him to the foot of the stand -- presenting him,
as it were, to his Prince. The Prince, in turn, responds
delightedly with enthusiastic applause, as do his companions
in thé royal box. Eric looks up at them -- the irony of the
situation hardly lost on him.

THEN -- he sees them, His eye zooms in on two familiar figure:
sitting with Clare, Jo, Bunty, and Sandy. It's Rob and xX
Jennie. Eric's eyes meet his sister's, she smiles and claps
her hands with the others. To Eric, this is the greatest gift
of all. He looks then for Clare. She waves a wave of
good-bye, Eric understands and waves @ final wave back, Then
the hats lift about him, the cheers resound as we:

Eric, now in travelling clothes, has been hoisted shoulder

carried to the waiting taxis which are to carry the team away.

Then Stallard is lifted up, followed by the protesting x
Aubrey.
The press are there barking questions -- books, papers are

thrust up for them to sign ~~ 45 they're bundled into the
cabs with the rest of their comrades and slowly, triumphantly
borne away.

The crowd cheers and runs and follows -- tumbling after and
melting in the wake of the convoy.

As they clear, a few lingering pressmen look back at the

deserted platform -- containing nothing but the emptied train

"yo Abrahams" they say -- before chasing onto the cars to
follow the others.

As the steam and exhaust clear, FIND two figures standing,
left, alone. It's Sybil and Harold's mother -- waiting --
waiting for Harold who hasn't come. They 100k down the
deserted platform -- then <- out of the empty train -~ steps
a tall lone figure carrying nis luggage. It's Harold.

smilies and nods to Sybil to go ahead.

Sybil's pace quickens as Harold nears. He drops his bags
and waits. Their eyes meet and then she runs and flings
herself into his arms...to be swung around in relief and
happiness.

A news vendor is selling newspapers -~ on the placard:

"Our Boys Return.

ABRAHAMS the toast of England.”
Harold sees it -- arms around his mother and Sybil. He sees
the placard as they walk past...and smiles a sad smile. They

disappear out of a station still echoing with the cheers
outside as the strains of "Jerusalem" lift about them.
