FADE IN:
1 INT. ALICE'S ROOM -- NIGHT 1
A little bit of moonlight coming in through the tiny window
might make a highlight here and there but that's about all.
Words begin to crawl across the screen.
Of good family, albeit one of modest means, she was a comely
young woman and not without prospects. Therefore it was at
once heartbreaking and astonishing to her mother that she
would enter into marriage with William Munny, a known thief
and murderer, a man of notoriously vicious and intemperate
disposition.
We can hear STRAWBERRY ALICE and DAVEY BUNTING breathing
heavily and the bed creaking. Written words crawl:
"They were married in St. Louis in 1870 and they traveled
north to Kansas where he engaged in farming and swine
husbandry".
DAVEY and ALICE are picking up speed now, breathing faster
and even snorting a little, and it's cold as Jesus in Nebraska
in the winter, so when the blanket slips, Alice snarls and
gasps.
ALICE
The blanket, for chrissake, cowboy,
the blanket.
There are six of these little rooms... one for each whore...
behind Greely's Beer Garden and Billiards, and the walls are
just boards, so you can hear what's happening in the other
rooms and right now, from DELILAH's room, you can hear a
high-pitched, merry little giggle and that's important.
Written words crawl: She bore him two children in the eight
years of their marriage and when she died, it was not at his
hands as her mother might have expected, but of smallpox.
That was 1878.
DELILAH (O.S.)
No, please... No, no goddamn you.
ALICE and DAVEY have stopped fucking and started listening,
but they don't move. Written words crawl: "It wasn't until
1881... three years later... that a cowboy named MIKE cut up
a whore in Big Whiskey, Nebraska, in the Niobrara River
country".
END CRAWL.

MIKE (O.S.)
Davey, come a runnin', lad, an' hold
the thieving cunt...
A blur of action as DAVEY leaps from the bed and dashes out
of the room, naked...
MIKE (O.S.)
... Brand you like a damn steer,
bitch...
And ALICE is right behind him, wrapping herself in a blanket
as she goes.
2 INT. DELILAH'S ROOM -- NIGHT 2
DELILAH is backed up against the wall, her face bleeding,
and she is throwing the contents of her chamber pot on MIKE,
who is advancing on her with an open barlow knife, and DAVEY
busts into the room naked and ALICE follows him and PEOPLE
are shouting in other rooms.
MIKE
(wiping shit off
himself)
Hold the bitch, Davey, hold her.
The one coal oil lamp in the room gives off just enough light
that you can make all this out. Certainly you can see that
MIKE, who is wearing leggings and no shirt, is a big tough
man, unshaven, eyes inflamed with whiskey...
MIKE
(continuing)
Hold her! dammit. Davey! If you don't
hold her I'll cut her tits off.
LITTLE SUE, a fifteen-year-old whore, is in the doorway,
eyes wide with terror, and ALICE screams at her.
ALICE
Get Skinny, for God's sake! Skinny!
DAVEY is reluctant about the whole thing but he is afraid of
MIKE and he gets behind DELILAH and grabs her.
DAVEY
Wh-what you gonna do, Mike?
MIKE is doing it now and DELILAH is screaming while he carves
her face with the barlow knife and blood is all over,
splashing on DAVEY, and DAVEY, who is just a kid, after all,
(CONTINUED)

nineteen with a big shock of unruly red hair and innocent
blue eyes, is horrified.
MIKE
Thieving cunt, I'll...
DAVEY
Mike, don't, Jesus, don't...
ALICE
Skinny! Bring your gun.
ALICE can't wait for SKINNY and she jumps on MIKE'S back and
brings the big man down and she fights him though she's not
a big woman. ALICE is twenty-five but she's been around some,
whored some tough cow towns, and she has too much bone and
character in her face to be outright pretty but she attracts
men like flies. Sure she has some smallpox scars on her face,
but they're common and there are only a few of them, not
like on SKINNY, whose mean little face is eaten right up
with them.
ANGLE ON SKINNY DUBOIS
Standing there in the doorway, his nasty face eaten with
smallpox scars and he is looking at DELILAH, who is a fountain
of blood, looking at her coldly, and looking down at the
melee on the floor, and pointing the big Navy Colt in his
hand, he says:
SKINNY
Get offa her, asshole.
And he says it so cold and with such authority that everything
goes quiet.
3 EXT. MAIN STREET -- NIGHT (SNOW, MOONLIGHT) 3
Shadowy buildings and the silence of the Nebraska winter
except for the sound of the snowshoes.
The snow has obliterated the main street of Big Whiskey,
giving the impression that the dark, low buildings are
scattered at random. The only structure with any sign of
life is Greely's Beer Garden and Billiards, which shows a
glowing window and two horses out front, and that is a hundred
yards away from the struggling silhouettes of the two men on
snowshoes. The big one is LITTLE BILL DAGGETT and he is very
big, wrapped in a huge bearskin robe.
The smaller one is CLYDE LEDBETTER, who isn't small though
he has only one arm.
(CONTINUED)
4.
3 CONTINUED: 3
LITTLE BILL
... Wouldn't let you settle it, huh?
CLYDE
Hell, you know how Skinny is. Says
he's gonna shoot 'em... an' I says,
"Skinny, you can't do that," an' he
says, "Well, then get Little Bill
down here an' let's settle this" an'
I says "Bill's sleepin', Skinny,"
an'...
They make their way in silence through the snow, getting
close now, close to Greely's and the lights.
4 INT. DELILAH'S ROOM -- NIGHT 4
DELILAH on her bed, her face covered with blood-soaked rags
except for her eyes. ALICE has hot water and is ministering
to her and LITTLE BILL is looking down at her from his
enormous height, still in his bearskin. He looks disgusted.
LITTLE BILL
She ain't gonna die, huh?
You can see the fear in DELILAH's eyes, and the other
whores... CROW CREEK KATE with crazy pop eyes and frizzy
hair, and LITTLE SUE, who is fifteen and meek even when she
isn't terrified, and FAITH, who is the oldest of them and
not very attractive and SILKY, who is blond and the
prettiest... are watching from vantage points in the doorway
or in the room.
ALICE
(determined)
She's gonna live.
(as LITTLE BILL turns
to go)
She didn't steal nothin', she didn't
touch his poke.
LITTLE BILL
(stopping and turning)
No?
ALICE
All she done was... when she seen he
had a teensy little pecker... she
give a giggle. That's all. She didn't
know no better.
LITTLE BILL turns away, disgusted, and starts out of the
room and ALICE gets up and follows him.
(CONTINUED)
5.
4 CONTINUED: 4
ALICE
(continuing)
You gonna hang 'em, Little Bill?
5 INT. BARROOM -- NIGHT 5
DAVEY sitting naked on the floor of the barroom and MIKE is
sitting near him, still in his leggings and both men are
shivering because they are fifteen feet from the potbellied
stove, where CLYDE is standing watching them.
It is a big room, with a crude bar and four tables and some
moose and elk heads on the wall. The door near the rear where
it says BILLIARD ROOM leads not to a billiard room but to
the six little "rooms" that are the whorehouse and now you
can hear DELILAH groaning from there.
And LITTLE BILL enters from the back of the barroom, stooping
to pass through the doorway under the sign that says BILLIARD
ROOM.
LITTLE BILL is huge and ominous. Some say he acquired the
bearskin by staring the bear to death and others say he
drowned the animal in spit. Anyhow, he's big with a drooping
moustache and he is sucking on his church warden's clay pipe
and you know he isn't scared of anything.
And the two cowboys are scared to death not just shivering
from the cold, and BILL just looks down at them and sucks on
his pipe and ALICE comes in from the back way, too, and then
SKINNY and a couple of the whores gather in the doorway.
LITTLE BILL
Clyde, step across to the German's
an' fetch up one of his bullwhips.
Stark terror on the faces of DAVEY and MIKE as CLYDE exits.
ALICE
A whippin'? That's all they get?
After what they done?
LITTLE BILL
(sucking on his pipe)
Whippin' ain't a little thing, Alice.
ALICE
But what they done, they...
(CONTINUED)
6.
5 CONTINUED: 5
SKINNY
(he has a piece of
paper in his hand)
Shut up, Alice. Little Bill, a
whippin' ain't gonna settle this.
LITTLE BILL
No?
SKINNY
(showing the paper)
This here's a lawful contract...
betwixt me an' Delilah Fitzgerald,
the cut whore. Now I brung her clear
from Boston, paid her expenses an'
all, an' I got a contract which
represents an investment of capital.
LITTLE BILL
(sympathetic to the
argument)
Property.
SKINNY
Damaged property. Like if I was to
hamstring one of their cow ponies.
LITTLE BILL
You figure nobody'll want to fuck
her.
SKINNY
Hell no. Leastways, they won't pay
to do it.
ALICE is listening to this and her eyes are like coals and
you can hear DELILAH moaning in the other room.
SKINNY
(continuing)
She could maybe clean up around the
place or somethin', but nobody's
gonna pay good money for a cut-up
whore.
LITTLE BILL
(making up his mind
and turning to the
shivering cowboys)
You boys are off of the Spade Outfit.
Got your own string of ponies?
(CONTINUED)
7.
5 CONTINUED: (2) 5
DAVEY
(nodding)
I... I got f-f-f-four.
LITTLE BILL
You?
MIKE
(sullenly)
Six.
SKINNY nods, pleased, and ALICE watches, her eyes still hot.
LITTLE BILL
Guess you boys just as soon not have
no trial an' fuss, huh?
DAVEY and MIKE nod, willing to say anything LITTLE BILL wants.
LITTLE BILL
(continuing; to MIKE)
All right. You done the cuttin'...
Come the thaw, you bring in five of
them ponies an' give 'em over to
Skinny here.
MIKE
Five!
LITTLE BILL
(to DAVEY)
An' you... you give over two ponies,
hear?
CLYDE bangs in out of the snow with a buggy whip in his hand.
CLYDE
I couldn't find no bullwhips, Bill.
The German...
LITTLE BILL
Don't matter, we don't need no whips.
(to MIKE and DAVEY)
Spring comes an' Skinny don't have
them ponies, I'm gonna...
ALICE
You... you ain't even gonna... whip
'em?
LITTLE BILL
I fined 'em instead.
(CONTINUED)
8.
5 CONTINUED: (3) 5
ALICE
For what they done? Skinny gets some
ponies an' that's...?
LITTLE BILL
(approaching her)
Ain't you seen enough blood for one
night? Hell, Alice, they ain't loafers
nor tramps nor bad men. They're
hardworkin' boys that was foolish.
Why, if they was given over to
wickedness in a regular way...
ALICE
(furious)
Like whores?
SKINNY
Alice, tend to Delilah.
For a long moment ALICE just stands there glaring.
6 INT. DELILAH'S ROOM -- DAY 6
Basin of bloody water and LITTLE SUE is just dipping another
towel in the hot water next to DELILAH's bed, changing the
bandages.
All the whores are there in various states of dress, lounging
on the floor, leaning against the wall.
SILKY
(to ALICE)
If Delilah don't care one way or the
other, what're you so riled about?
ALICE
(Passionately)
Just because them smelly assholes
like to ride us like horses don't
mean we got to let 'em brand us like
we're horses. Maybe we ain't nothin'
but whores, but by God we ain't
horses.
SILKY is thinking it over, frowning, and then she makes her
decision.
SILKY
(to ALICE)
I got a hundred an' twelve dollars.
That's everythin'.
(CONTINUED)
9.
6 CONTINUED: 6
ALICE
What about you, Faith?
FAITH
(reluctantly). Two hundred...
There are gasps.
FAITH
(continuing)
... . Two hundred an' forty.
ALICE
(Laughing)
Jesus, Faith, what you been doin',
givin' Skinny somethin' special?
All the women laugh and DELILAH through her bandages makes a
gurgling sound and LITTLE SUE's eyes light up.
LITTLE SUE
(indicating DELILAH)
She laughed.
ALICE
With what Kate got, Silky got some,
an' mine, an' Little S...
SILKY
(soberly)
It ain't enough.
ALICE
(Determined)
Not yet, maybe.
7 EXT. HOG PEN -- DAY 7
The hog in the mud, snorting and squealing, ugly as hell and
BILL MUNNY in the mud with him, pushing and shoving, trying
to move the stubborn animal and MUNNY goes down face first
and comes up more covered with mud than he already was and
the words on the screen say (superimposed):
"Some months later, Hodgeman County, Kansas".
MUNNY is thirty-five or forty years old, his hair is thinning
and his moustache droops glumly over his stubbled jaw. if it
were not for his eyes he would look like any pig farmer with
his canvas overalls tucked in his boots pushing on a hog. he
is pushing on the hog again, grunting with the effort, when
he hears the voice.
(CONTINUED)
10.
7 CONTINUED: 7
THE KID (O.S.)
You don't look like no rootin'
tootin', sonafabitchin', cold-blooded
assassin.
MUNNY
(looking up, startled)
Huh?
THE KID is only six feet away, the sun behind him, sitting
on a very big and very ancient Morgan horse. He's wearing a
wide-brimmed Texas hat, a vest, a holstered pistol, and he
is a wiry kid, maybe twenty years old, with scraggly blond
hair, four of his upper front teeth missing, and a funny,
squinty way of looking out of his watery-blue eyes. Most of
all, he doesn't look very prosperous.
THE KID
I seen how you got only three fingers
on your left hand, though, so I guess
you're callin' yourself Mr. Bill
Munny.
MUNNY does indeed have three fingers on his left hand and he
doesn't like this conversation at all.
MUNNY
William Munny, yeah.
THE KID
Same one as shot Charlie Pepper in
Lake County?
VOICE (O.S.)
Paw! Hey, Paw!
The voice belongs to WILL, a skinny ten-year-old who dashes
up with his seven-year-old sister, PENNY, right on his heels.
The kids are ragged and dirty, they don't look well fed or
even very healthy. Even as WILL speaks to his father, MUNNY,
his eyes, and PENNY's too, go to THE KID. They don't see
many strangers.
MUNNY
What is it, son?
WILL
Two more hogs got the fever.
MUNNY winces. THE KID ignores the interruption.
(CONTINUED)
11.
7 CONTINUED: (2) 7
THE KID
You shot Charlie Pepper, didn't you?
And you're the one killed William
Harbey an' robbed the train over...
MUNNY
(sharply)
Hold on, mister.
(to WILL)
Son, this here pig gotta be moved
outta this pen, away from them others.
Penny you give yer brother a hand...
PENNY
(emotional)
This one's sick, too?
MUNNY ignores the question, already on his way to the
miserable-looking shack.
MUNNY
Let's talk inside, mister.
8 INT. SOD HUT -- DAY 8
MUNNY selects a tin cup from a wash pan of dirty dishes. It
is dark and cool inside his one-room sod hut... and poor.
THE KID checks one of the three chairs for stability before
sitting down.
MUNNY
You're Pete Sothow's nephew, huh?
Hell, I thought maybe you was someone
come to kill me...
(He has the cups and
he crosses to the
fire.)
... for somethin' I done in the old
days.
THE KID
(sitting)
I could've... easy.
MUNNY
Yeah, I guess so.
THE KID
Like I was sayin', you don't look no
meaner-than-hell cold-blooded damn
killer.
(CONTINUED)
12.
8 CONTINUED: 8
MUNNY
Maybe I ain't.
THE KID
Well, Uncle Pete said you was the
goddamndest meanest son of a bitch
ever lived an' if I ever wanted a
partner for a killin', you was the
worst one. Meanin' the best. On
account of you're cold as snow an'
don't have no weak nerve nor fear.
MUNNY serves the coffee gloomily and sits down. It appears
his feelings and hurt, but THE KID doesn't notice.
MUNNY
He said that, huh?
THE KID
I'm a damn killer myself, only I
ain't killed so many as you because
of my youth. Schofield Kid, they
call me.
MUNNY
Schofield? You from Schofield?
THE KID
(laying his Smith &
Wesson Schofield .5
on the table)
On account of my Schofield model
Smith and Wesson pistol.
MUNNY
Oh.
THE KID
Well, how about it?
MUNNY
About what?
THE KID
Bein' my partner. I'm headin' north
up around the Niobrara in Nebraska.
Gonna kill a couple of no good
cowboys.
MUNNY
What for?
(CONTINUED)
13.
8 CONTINUED: (2) 8
THE KID
For cuttin' up a lady. They cut up
her face an' cut her eyes out, cut
her ears off an' her tits, too.
MUNNY
(horrified)
Jesus!
THE KID
(pleased with the
reaction)
Thousand dollars of reward. Five
hundred apiece.
WILL
Paw, I can't move that damn pig.
WILL has slipped into the house with PENNY in tow and they
are both covered with mud, and WILL is swearing to show off
to the stranger.
MUNNY
(embarrassed)
No cussin' now, Will. Go on out the
pump an' clean up some an' I'll be
along. Check them other pens.
The two kids back out the door, eyes on the pistol and the
stranger, and MUNNY walks over near the beds with his back
to THE KID.
MUNNY
(continuing)
I ain't like that no more, Kid.
Whiskey done it as much as anythin'
I guess.
(turning to THE KID)
I ain't touched a drop in ten years.
My wife, she cured me of it... cured
me of drink an' wickedness.
THE KID
Well... you don't look so prosperous.
Hell, you could buy her a new dress
out of your half. We could kill them
two an' you could buy your wife one
of them fancy --
MUNNY
She's passed on, Kid.
(CONTINUED)
14.
8 CONTINUED: (3) 8
THE KID
Huh?
MUNNY
Been gone near three years now.
THE KID
(staring stupidly)
Oh.
9 EXT. SOD HUT -- DAY 9
WILL and PENNY in front of the house, looking up at THE KID,
who is mounted again, and MUNNY is standing there taking
leave of THE KID.
THE KID
Don't tell nobody about the reward
an' all. Don't need no other gunmen
tryin' to collect.
MUNNY
I don't never see nobody anyhow.
THE KID
(riding away)
If you was to change your mind, might
be you could catch me... due west to
the Western Trail an' north to
Ogallala.
MUNNY waves at THE KID and for a long moment watches him
trot across the flat, grassy fields. Then he turns back to
his shabby farm and the squealing pigs and the two children,
who are looking up at him.
WILL
Who's he?
MUNNY
(turning away)
Best we move that pig.
10 EXT. HOG PEN -- DAY 10
MUNNY in the mud and the pig squealing and WILL is there
pushing, too, and MUNNY goes in face first again, and when
he comes up he slowly wipes mud from his face and, turning,
he looks across the fields.
ANGLE ON PENNY
Coming up beside the pen.
(CONTINUED)
15.
10 CONTINUED: 10
PENNY
Paw... two of them others... I think
they got the fever.
MUNNY frowns and looks off at the horizon, lost in thought.
ANGLE ON KID
Way off in the distance, disappearing on the horizon.
11 EXT. BIG WHISKEY HILL -- EXTREME CLOSE-UP ON DELILAH -- DAY 11
DELILAH's face! The cut whore. Skeins of crisscrossing raised
flesh, a vicious web of scars dominated by her eyes that are
deep and beautiful.
WIDER ANGLE She's hanging clothes on a clothesline on Big
Whiskey Hill, the gentle slope above the town. ALICE, LITTLE
SUE, SILKY, KATE, and FAITH are close by, hanging clothes or
washing them in the gurgling stream.
FAITH is the first to glance down the hill toward the town
and to notice. She draws in her breath and turns to ALICE
and catches her eye, and ALICE looks down.
12 EXT. MUDDY NORTH ROAD 12
The muddy North Road and the two riders, and they are QUICK
MIKE and DAVEY BUNTING leading their ponies in, passing a
crudely painted sign that says:
"Ordinance 14. No firearms in Big Whiskey. Deposit them at
County Office. By Order of Sheriff".
13 EXT. BIG WHISKEY HILL -- DAY 13
The whores on the hill. One by one, with no words exchanged,
they feel the silence and turn and exchange glances, and
they glance at DELILAH. She winces and turns back to hanging
clothes.
ANGLE ON Horse's Open Mouth and SKINNY.
Inspecting.
SKINNY
You boys took a while. Couple more
days I was gonna call on the Sheriff.
The horses are gathered in front of Greely's and SKINNY moves
among them inspecting them while the two cowboys remain
mounted.
(CONTINUED)
16.
13 CONTINUED: 13
DAVEY
River was swole so we couldn't cross
her.
DAVEY is holding the halter of a little paint and when SKINNY
starts to inspect the paint, DAVEY pulls the pony away.
DAVEY
(continuing)
You got two of mine. This here one
ain't yours.
SKINNY and DAVEY lock eyes, and SKINNY is wondering how far
to push it when splat!... DAVEY gets a face full of mud. The
three men turn to see the whores coming around the side of
Greely's, all except DELILAH, and they are throwing mud,
scooping it from the sloppy street and...
MIKE gets a hit on the chest and then on the face and he
gives an ugly look and wheels his horse and digs in his spurs
and heads north at a trot, and mud continues to rain on him
as the whores jeer.
SKINNY
Damn you.
(splat)
That ain't no way to behave.
(splat)
Quit that.
Surprisingly, DAVEY turns his horse right into the barrage
of mud, and taking it in the face and on the chest, he
dismounts. His paint takes a big gob of mud on one eye and
DAVEY wipes the mud off tenderly.
DAVEY
This here pony... I brung it for the
lady... the one my partner cut.
The whores stop throwing mud abruptly. There is a pause...
and they can see that he is just a kid, and that he is sorry
as hell and that he is about to cry, and they are touched,
especially LITTLE SUE.
DAVEY
(continuing)
It's the best of the lot... better
than the ones I give him.
(indicating SKINNY)
She could sell it or... what she
wants.
(CONTINUED)
17.
13 CONTINUED: (2) 13
ALICE
(recovering)
A pony... She ain't got no face left
an' you're gonna give her a goddamn
mangy pony.
DAVEY
He ain't m-m-mangy, ma'am, he...
Slop. DAVEY gets it in the face with a big gob of mud as
ALICE resumes fire and splat, the paint gets it.
FAITH and SILKY and KATE hesitate just a moment... and then
they dig in and start jeering and throwing again, and LITTLE
SUE bends down slowly and picks up some mud and then she
just stands there with it, almost crying, and watches the
cowboy turn away under a barrage of mud, and mount his pony
and ride out, mud hitting him all over and the women jeering
and running after him in the muddy street.
ANGLE ON DELILAH
Hanging clothes up on the hill and she can hear the shouting
in the distance and she turns and looks down with the
beautiful eyes and sees the cowboy riding out of town slowly,
chased by the jeering women.
14 INT. SOD HUT -- CLOSE ON PHOTOGRAPH -- DAY 14
Of Claudia in MUNNY's hands.
WIDER ANGLE He is inside, kneeling on the floor beside an
open trunk, and he is studying reverently the old photo of
Claudia, smiling radiantly in her best dress. Finally, MUNNY
puts the picture down and digs in the trunk among folded
dresses that belonged to her, until he feels something metal
and he sees the blue steel among the white cloth and then he
pulls it out... an old Starr .44 pistol.
15 EXT. SOD HUT -- CLOSE ON MOJAV COFFEE TIN -- DAY 15
As MUNNY places it on the fence behind his sod hut.
WIDER ANGLE MUNNY has the Starr in his right hand and he
turns and walks back toward the house fifteen yards away.
WILL and PENNY are watching. They know something is going
on, but they don't know how to ask what it is.
MUNNY faces the coffee tin and solemnly extends his pistol
arm straight out and carefully sights along the barrel.
(CONTINUED)
18.
15 CONTINUED: 15
Bam! A burst of flame and a puff of black smoke from the
gun.
The Mojav tin hasn't moved.
Slowly, carefully, MUNNY raises the gun again and aims with
great deliberation.
Bam! The coffee tin doesn't move.
MUNNY shakes his head slowly in disgust and aims again.
Bam! Missed again.
MUNNY gives a quick sheepish glance in the direction of the
children. There is a lot of smoke. He aims again and --
Bam! He misses.
MUNNY is irritated and he aims and fires hastily, and flame
bursts from the gun and smoke and --
The tin is unmoved.
WILL looks at his feet, embarrassed, not wanting to meet his
father's eyes.
MUNNY stuffs the pistol in his waistband and disappears into
the house.
WILL and PENNY look at one another nervously, wondering what's
happening.
PENNY
Did Paw used to kill folks?
WILL doesn't answer and then he looks up because MUNNY steps
out of the house again, a sawed-off Remington 10-gauge shotgun
in his hands.
MUNNY raises the double-barreled weapon to his shoulder and
aims carefully and...
Barrrrooooom! The can flies away in pieces and some of the
fence, too.
16 EXT. SHADE TREES -- DAY 16
HEADSTONE. IT SAYS:
CLAUDIA FEATHERS MUNNY
(CONTINUED)
19.
16 CONTINUED: 16
"Born, March 11, 1849 Died, August 6, 1878, aged 29 years,
in the full enjoyment of that love which constrained her to
leave all for Christ and heathen souls."
Lo, we have left all and followed thee:
What shall we leave therefore. 19:25"
The headstone is under a couple of shade trees fifty yards
from the sod hut. MUNNY is sitting on a rock under the trees
looking at the headstone, and he has on a cheap black suit
now. He twists the hat, tormented... and he starts to say
something out loud but he can't because men don't talk to
stones. So finally he gets up, slumped in defeat, and he
puts a little bouquet of flowers on the grave and he turns
away unhappily.
17 EXT. SOD HUT -- DAY 17
The albino mare snorting and shying, anxious to lose the
saddle. WILL has her by the halter, holding her with effort,
in front of the house.
WILL
She ain't hardly a saddle horse no
more, Paw. She ain't used to the
feel.
MUNNY walks up and puts his hand on PENNY'S head, fondly.
MUNNY
Them flowers, Penny, I could tell
your Maw liked them, hear?
(turning to WILL)
Take care of your sister, son. You
can kill three chickens if you need,
not no more. Keep the hogs that got
fever separate if you can. An' if
you need help, go see Sally Two-Trees
over to Ned Logan's.
Then he turns to the mare and shoves a foot in the stirrup
to mount, but the horse shies and MUNNY goes down in the
dust looking very undignified.
And PENNY is horrified and humiliated for her father, whom
she worships, and WILL's eyes are big because MUNNY's coat
came open and he caught a quick glimpse of the Starr pistol
stuck in the waistband.

(brushing himself
off, embarrassed).)
Ain't felt a saddle in a while myself.
Then MUNNY has one foot in the stirrup and the horse starts
to shy, and MUNNY has to hop around with one foot stirruped
and the other not... and when he tries to swing aboard he
falls back...
MUNNY
Easy, old gal, easy...
And he still can't make it, so to cover his embarrassment he
talks to the kids while he hops around desperately trying to
mount.
MUNNY
(continuing)
Now this here horse is gettin' even
on me... hold on, gal... for the
sins of my youth... In my youth...
before I met... your dear, departed
mother... I was weak an' givin' to
mistreatin' horses an' such. An'
this here horse... an' that ol' pig,
too, I guess... is my comeuppance
for my cruelty...
At last he is in the saddle and takes a deep breath.
MUNNY
(continuing)
Used to be I could cuss an' hurt an
animal... till your departed mother,
God rest her, showed me the error of
my ways.
MUNNY turns the albino mare and starts out the gate going
west toward the fields.
MUNNY
(continuing; over his
shoulder).)
I won't be no longer than a couple
of weeks. Remember how the spirit of
your departed maw watches over you.
WILL and PENNY are watching him go and WILL is fighting back
the tears, but PENNY has lost the battle and she is crying
and the horse whinnies.
(CONTINUED)

17 CONTINUED: (2) 17
ANGLE ON MUNNY
Twenty yards away, getting up off the ground and trying to
catch the shying, prancing horse on foot, his dignity a
shambles.
18 INT. ALICE'S ROOM -- NIGHT 18
ALICE in pain because SKINNY is twisting her arm and they
are in ALICE's room... It is still night... and the other
whores are there, scared, nervous.
SKINNY
(furious)
Where'd you get the money, huh?
ALICE
(in pain)
We ain't got it. We ain't got no
money.
SKINNY
You told them cowboys you had it.
ALICE
We was... lyin'.
SKINNY
(lets her go)
What you gonna do when somebody comes
to collect?
(yelling)
Fuck 'em? Fuck 'em a thousand times?
(goes to door, then
stops)
The kind of people who'll come after
that thousand, they won't tolerate
if you don't have it. They won't
just cut your face up a little.
(screaming)
Stupid cunts!
19 EXT. LITTLE BILL'S HOUSE -- ANGLE ON HOT SUN -- DAY 19
Blazing down.
Bang, bang, bang, hammer on nail and the fingers holding the
nail are swollen and purple and then... whup, hammer on flesh.
LITTLE BILL
Oh, shit, shit an' damn, oh fuck my
mother and my father, oh damn an'
Jesus.
(CONTINUED)
22.
19 CONTINUED: 19
LITTLE BILL is hopping around in his hat and boots and nothing
else in front of his brand new one-story, fourroom frame
house that hasn't been painted it's so new and doesn't have
a porch yet, though that is being begun... sort of. In fact...
the house doesn't look quite right... looks a little lopsided.
SKINNY DUBOIS is standing there, in the clearing, wiping his
brow and catching his breath and watching LITTLE BILL.
SKINNY
Hit your finger, huh?
LITTLE BILL
(surprised)
Huh? Hullo, Skinny. Snuck up on me.
(indicating the house
proudly)
How do you like her?
SKINNY
(looking critically)
Heard you done the roof yourself.
LITTLE BILL
Roof? Jesus, Skinny, I done
practically every damn thing myself.
Roberts boy hauled wood, that's all.
SKINNY
What's all that wood?
LITTLE BILL
(enthusiastically)
Porch. I'm puttin' a porch on her
so's I can puff my pipe of an evening
an' drink my coffee an' watch the
sun set.
LITTLE BILL is back at it, hauling a four-by-six into
position.
LITTLE BILL
(continuing; over his
shoulder, proudly).)
You come clear up here just to get a
look at her?
The train whistle screams loudly below in the valley and,
turning nervously, SKINNY can see a puff of steam above the
distant trees.
SKINNY
Them whores...
(CONTINUED)
23.
19 CONTINUED: (2) 19
He pauses, reluctant to go on. LITTLE BILL isn't really paying
attention to anything but his house.
LITTLE BILL
Yeah?
SKINNY
Them whores, they been fuckin' an
fuckin' all them cowboys that come
into town the last two weeks...
LITTLE BILL
(chuckling).)
Shit, Skinny, we got railroad barons
an' cattle barons, but you're gonna
be the first of the billiard barons.
SKINNY
(ignoring him)
.... They been fuckin' 'em, an'
tellin' every bowlegged one of 'em
how they're payin' a thousand dollars
to whatever son of a bitch kills
them two boys which cut up Delilah.
LITTLE BILL drops the board he's holding up and turns sharply
to SKINNY. Down in the valley the train whistle screams and,
after a long, tense moment, LITTLE BILL turns and looks out
over the valley, frowning.
LITTLE BILL
An' all them cowboys been riding
that beef down to Kansas an' Cheyenne?
SKINNY
(unhappily, dropping
his eyes).)
Yup.
LITTLE BILL
All week?
SKINNY
(apologetically).)
I didn't hear nothin' till last night.
LITTLE BILL
Word must have got all the way to
Texas by now.
(CONTINUED)
24.
19 CONTINUED: (3) 19
SKINNY
(quickly).)
Oh, shit, Bill, I guess nobody's
gonna come clear from Texas.
LITTLE BILL
(sitting down)
They really got all that money, them
whores?
SKINNY
(sitting beside bill)
You know how women kin lie... I knock
'em around a little, ask 'em where
the money is, they say they don't
have none... but they coulda
squirreled away that much, the five
of 'em. Maybe.
Pause.
LITTLE BILL
That much, huh?
SKINNY
(hopeful)
You could run off them two cowboys.
LITTLE BILL
(sharply)
I could run off them whores.
SKINNY
(after a pause)
Well, I guess they'll just up an'
run anyhow, them two.
LITTLE BILL
(glumly)
Nope. They'll stay out on the Spade
country where they got friends.
The train whistle screams down in the valley and the train
is chugging in the distance, pulling out, headed South.
SKINNY
Shit, Bill, could be nobody won't
come at all.
20 EXT. LOGAN HOUSE -- DAY 20
SALLY TWO TREES, weeding under a hot sun. She is an Indian
woman about forty years old, heavy, and she is pulling weeds
(CONTINUED)
25.
20 CONTINUED: 20
from a neat garden near the Logan House and she looks up and
she sees something and frowns and keeps looking and doesn't
like what she sees.
HER POV -- MAN
in the distance riding an albino mare, making his way slowly
through the prosperous fields of young corn.
ANGLE ON SALLY
She looks over at her husband, NED LOGAN, who is working not
far away and he seems to "hear" her look because he turns to
her and, seeing her troubled expression, he follows her look
and he, too, sees the rider on the albino mare.
NED
I'll be damned. It's Billy Munny.
NED is about forty, balding, a farmer, but not as seedylooking as his old friend, BILL MUNNY.
ANGLE ON MUNNY
Trying to dismount and the albino prancing and MUNNY
staggering and SALLY looking at the scene grimly.
MUNNY
(awkwardly)
Hullo, Sally... I... uh, I ain't
seen you in near as long as this,
uh... as this horse ain't felt the
saddle.
MUNNY gets up out of the dust looking uncomfortable and SALLY
just stares at him coldly.
NED
(warmly)
Come on in outta the sun, Bill. Sally,
you see to Bill's horse.
MUNNY nods an uncomfortable thank-you to SALLY as NED leads
him toward a house that is very different from MUNNY's. It
is a two-story frame house, freshly painted and surrounded
by a well-tended garden, a toolshed, a barn, and lush fields.
As the men disappear into the house, SALLY leads the albino
toward the barn. Her sharp eyes don't miss the stock of the
shotgun where it protrudes slightly from the bedroll. Her
eyes seem to see even into the future... and all they see is
trouble.
26.
21 INT. LOGAN HOUSE -- CLOSE ON CLEAN CERAMIC COFFEE MUGS -- 21
DAY
as NED takes them from a tidy cabinet in his cozy kitchen
with the castiron stove, the solid table.
WIDER ANGLE MUNNY is sitting at the table looking moodily
into space.
NED
(earnestly)
We ain't bad men no more, Bill. Hell,
we're farmers.
MUNNY
(thoughtfully)
Should be easy killin' 'em...
supposin' they don't run off to Texas
first.
NED
(taking the pot from
the stove).)
How long since you shot a gun at a
man?
(pause)
Nine... ten years?
MUNNY
Eleven.
NED
Easy, huh? Hell, I don't know that
it was all that easy then... an' we
was young an' full of beans.
(pouring coffee)
Bill... if you was mad at 'em... if
they done you wrong... I could see
shootin' 'em...
MUNNY
(looking NED in the
eye)
We done stuff before for money, Ned.
NED
(sitting down)
Well, we thought we was doin' it for
money...
(he pauses, remembering)
... What'd they do, anyhow? Cheat at
cards, steal some strays, spit on a
rich fella?
(CONTINUED)
27.
21 CONTINUED: 21
MUNNY
Cut up a woman. Cut her eyes out,
cut her tits off, cut her fingers
off... done everythin' but cut up
her cunny, I guess.
NED
(after chewing on
that one)
Well, I guess they got it comin'...
(and he pauses and
looks MUNNY in the
eye)
... But you wouldn't go if Claudia
was alive.
It hits MUNNY like salt on a wound and he just takes it.
They both know NED is right and they think about it silently.
Finally MUNNY speaks glumly.
MUNNY
(getting up and going
to the door)
I guess you wouldn't mind to look in
on my youngsters next week. Might be
you could help them move a couple of
them pigs if they got to separate
'em more.
NED has been thinking about it while MUNNY's talking,
wrestling with it, and now MUNNY is out the door.
NED
How long you gonna be, Bill?
MUNNY
Two weeks, I guess.
NED
This Kid, what's he like?
MUNNY turns and looks at NED and their eyes meet and MUNNY
realizes NED is coming.
NED
(continuing)
Three ways?
MUNNY
Yup. You still got the Spencer rifle?
(CONTINUED)
28.
21 CONTINUED: (2) 21
NED
(grinning)
Yeah, an' I could still hit a bird
in the eye, flyin'.
22 EXT. LOGAN HOUSE -- DAY 22
MUNNY landing with a thud in the dust and picking himself up
hurriedly and casting a sheepish glance over his shoulder at
NED as he makes another awkward effort to mount the mare.
NED
(amazed at this
performance)
Jesus, Bill.
CLOSE ANGLE -- SALLY TWO TREES The sad, wise eyes of SALLY
TWO TREES as she watches the two riders disappearing in the
distance. Her eyes are saying good-bye.
23 EXT. PATH -- DAY 23
The riders in the distance. One horse is walking and the
white one is prancing and shying in an unruly manner while
her rider fights desperately for control.
24 EXT. OPEN COUNTRY -- DUSK (SUNSET) 24
NED and MUNNY riding in open country.
NED
He musta been movin' right along.
MUNNY
We'll come across him tomorra, I
guess.
25 EXT. CAMP -- NIGHT 25
And the sizzling campfire as NED empties the grease from the
frying pan into the fire.
MUNNY is already lying down, fussing in his blankets to get
comfortable and the crickets are chirping up a storm.
MUNNY
Got used to my bed. Ain't gonna feel
to home out here.
(CONTINUED)
29.
25 CONTINUED: 25
NED
(getting into his
blanket)
Well, it ain't just the bed I'm gonna
miss. I'm...
(He stops suddenly.)
... Hell, Billy, I'm sorry. I didn't
mean...
MUNNY
It ain't nothin', don't fret it.
(pause)
She don't like it much, you goin'
off with me.
NED
Sally?
MUNNY
She give me the evil eye.
NED
It's just... she's an Indian an'
Indians ain't... overfriendly.
MUNNY
I ain't blamin' her, Ned, I ain't
holdin' it against her.
(pause)
She knew me back then... an' she
seen what a no-good son of a bitch I
was... an' she won't allow how I've
changed. She just don't know how I
ain't like that no more.
NED
Well, she...
MUNNY
(urgently)
I ain't the same, Ned. Claudia, she...
straightened me up, got me clear of
the whiskey an' all. Us goin' to do
this killin'... that don't mean I'm
back to like I was. I just need the
money... for a new start... for them
youngsters.
(long pause)
Remember that drover, the one I shot
in the mouth so's the teeth come out
the back of his head?

25 CONTINUED: (2) 25
MUNNY (CONT'D)
I dream about him now an' again. I
didn't have no reason to shoot him...
not one I could remember when I
sobered up.
NED
You was a... a crazy son of a bitch.
MUNNY
Nobody liked me... none of the boys.
They was scared of me... figured I
might shoot 'em out of pure meanness.
NED
You ain't like that no more.
MUNNY
Eagle... he hated my guts. Bonaparte
didn't like me none.
NED
Nor Quincy, I guess.
MUNNY
Quincy, he was always watchin' me.
Scared.
NED
You ain't like that no more.
MUNNY
Hell, no. I'm just a fella now. Ain't
no different from anyone else no
more.
After a pause, NED rolls over to go to sleep and says
something kind by way of saying good night.
NED
Hell, Bill, I always liked you...
even back then.
NED settles in his covers and so does MUNNY and the crickets
chirp for a long moment but MUNNY can't sleep with the lie.
MUNNY
No, you didn't. You wasn't no
different, Ned.
And we...
CUT TO:
31.
26 EXT. TRAIN -- DAY 26
A train whistle screaming.
27 INT. RAILROAD COACH -- DAY 27
The headline on the newspaper says: "PRESIDENT GARFIELD
WOUNDED." FUZZY, a cowboy, is sitting in the rocking coach
reading the paper with great effort, partly because of the
motion of the train and partly because FUZZY can't read very
well... but CROCKER, the rough-looking cowboy on the seat
next to him, can't read at all.
CROCKER
All I want to know is what son of a
bitch shot him, that's all. Was it
one of them John Bull assholes?
Across the aisle two well-dressed gentlemen are sitting. The
one by the window, the lean one in the frock coat and slouch
hat, is W.W. BEAUCHAMP, and the one on the aisle, pudgy,
pink-cheeked, with neat muttonchop whiskers, wearing a frock
coat and waistcoat and a silk slouch hat in spite of the
heat, is ENGLISH BOB. ENGLISH BOB has beady blue eyes, is
about thirty-five, and pulls constantly on a good cigar.
ENGLISH BOB
(in a rich English
accent)
No, sir, I believe the would-be
murderer is a gentleman of French
ancestry... or so it would seem. I
hope I won't give offense if I observe
that the French are known to be a
race of assassins, though they can't
shoot worth a damn... any Frenchman
among the present company excluded
of course.
CROCKER, not liking or understanding the interruption, gives
ENGLISH BOB a hard stare.
FUZZY
(to CROCKER)
Says here a fellow by the name of
"Gitto." "G-U-I-T..."
CROCKER
(eyes on BOB)
Sounds like a damn John Bull to me.
"Gitto."
(CONTINUED)
32.
27 CONTINUED: 27
THURSTON, a cowboy sitting behind CROCKER, turns in his seat,
sensing the tension in the air and W. W. feels it, too, and
shifts uneasily but ENGLISH BOB is unperturbed and he pulls
cheerfully on his cigar.
ENGLISH BOB
Well, sirs... again not wishing to
give offense... it might be a good
idea if the country were to choose a
Queen... or even a King... rather
than a president. One isn't as quick
to take a shot at a King or a Queen.
The majesty of royalty, you see...
CROCKER
(provocative).)
Maybe you don't wish to give offense,
sir, but you are givin' it pretty
thick. This country don't need no
queens whatsoever, I guess.
CROCKER is shifting in his seat so that the revolver in his
holster is prominent and there is uneasy stirring among the
nearby passengers. A DRUMMER looks around for exits.
CROCKER
(continuing)
As a matter of fact, what I heard
about queens...
THURSTON
Shut up, Joe.
CROCKER
(to THURSTON)
Huh? What's got up your ass, Thirsty?
This dude asshole...
THURSTON
(to CROCKER, but his
eyes on BOB)
Might be the "dude!" is English Bob...
the one who works for the Union
Pacific shootin' Chinamen. Might be
he wants for some dumb cowboy to
touch his pistol... so's he can shoot
him down.
ENGLISH BOB, unperturbed, just pulls on his cigar.
(CONTINUED)
33.
27 CONTINUED: (2) 27
CROCKER
(sobered)
That a fact, mister? You English
Bob?
ENGLISH BOB
(affably)
Why don't we shoot some turkeys,
friend? Ten shots... a dollar a
turkey. I'll shoot for the Queen,
and you can shoot for... whomever.
28 EXT. TRAIN -- DAY 28
Turkeys bursting from long Nebraska grass as the train whistle
screams.
Blam! A turkey plummets to earth.
Blam! Another goes down.
ANGLE ON ENGLISH BOB
On the swaying platform between cars, his pistol smoking,
and BOB brings it up again fast and sights and Blam!
An explosion of feathers plummeting down and disappearing in
the long grass.
ANGLE ON OTHER SIDE OF PLATFORM
Where W.W. BEAUCHAMP, CROCKER, THURSTON, FUZZY and the nervous
DRUMMER, in a cheap bowler, are standing. They are all
impressed with the fact that ENGLISH BOB is one hell of a
shot with a pistol.
ENGLISH BOB
(to CROCKER)
I believe that's eight for me... to
one for you. A matter of seven of
your American dollars.
CROCKER
(grudgingly counting
silver dollars)
Pretty damn good shootin'...
(aring)
... for a John Bull.
(CONTINUED)

28 CONTINUED: 28
ENGLISH BOB
(accepting the money
cheerfully)
No doubt your aim was affected by
your grief over the injury to your...
uh... president.
29 EXT. TRAIN STOP -- DAY 29
Bawling cattle milling in the pens south of Big Whiskey, and
the train hissing and steaming at a standstill.
CLOSE ANGLE Two leather valises and a leather rifle case as
MUDDY CHANDLER tosses them on his mud wagon, a sort of open
stagecoach. The scene is one of chaos as the train steams
and hisses and baggage is tossed off and more is tossed on.
CHANDLER
It's a nickel up to Big Whiskey,
gentlemen.
W.W. hands CHANDLER the money and, as he and ENGLISH BOB
climb into the mud wagon, they are accosted by GERMANY JOE
SCHULTZ, who runs the livery stable and does horse business
with railway passengers on the side.
GERMANY JOE
I godd nize horzes I zell you, boyce.
Nize prize for Independence Day,
boyce.
30 EXT. MUD WAGON -- DAY 30
ENGLISH BOB and W.W. riding in the mud wagon, bouncing
uncomfortably in spite of the slow pace, and eating dust and
sweating profusely.
ENGLISH BOB
(irritably)
It's the climate does it. That and
the infernal distances.
W.W.
Does what?
ENGLISH BOB
Induces people to shoot persons in
high places.
(mopping his brow
with his handkerchief)
It's a savage country. That's the
second one shot in twenty years.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
35.
30 CONTINUED: 30
ENGLISH BOB (CONT'D)
It's uncivilized, shooting people of
substance.
The mud wagon rattles past the South Road sign. It is similar
to the one of the North Road and says: "No Firearms in Big
Whiskey. Ordinance 14. Deposit pistols and rifles County
Office".
31 EXT. BIG WHISKEY INN -- DAY 31
Deputy ANDY RUSSELL stepping out of the County Office as the
mud wagon clatters to a stop in front of the Big Whiskey
Inn.
ANDY is just twenty, a good-looking kid with a badge on his
vest and a holstered pistol. He watches the passengers climb
out of the mud wagon, and as ENGLISH BOB alights, his frock
coat parts and gives ANDY just the quickest glimpse of a
holstered pistol under the coat.
ANDY
Pardon me, gentlemen, but local
ordinance obliges you to surrender
your sidearms to proper authority
for the duration of your visit.
W.W. looks at ENGLISH BOB and ENGLISH BOB turns and looks
ANDY up and down very coolly.
ENGLISH BOB
Proper authority, eh?
(breezily)
Well, sir... neither my companion
nor I carry firearms on our
persons. Rather, we trust in the
goodwill of our fellow man and the
forbearance of reptiles.
And ENGLISH BOB gives a smart bow, turns with a swirl of
coattails that allows a brief glimpse of not one, but two
holstered pistols, and marches off. As W.W. follows ENGLISH
BOB, he glances nervously back to see what young ANDY will
do but ANDY just stares nonplussed. In that quick glimpse,
ANDY saw how the weapons were tied down with thongs, meaning
the owner wanted a quick pull... and this shit is out of his
league.
32 INT. COUNTY OFFICE -- DAY 32
Ker-chick, clack, a Henry rifle cocked and the action checked.
ANDY is cleaning the weapon in the County Office.

nervously)
Christ, it's hot.
FATTY
(cheerfully)
If I'm gonna get shot, I druther it
was hot than cold. Everythin' hurts
me more in the cold.
FATTY is sitting in a chair in front of the empty jail cell
cleaning a revolver, oblivious to the tension.
FATTY
(continuing)
You know how if you hit your thumb
in the cold, how it...?
CHARLEY
Shut up, Fatty.
FATTY
I only said...
Outside a horse clatters up fast and ANDY jumps nervously to
the window.
ANDY
Clyde's back.
CHARLEY
Little Bill with him?
ANDY
No.
CHARLEY
(worried)
Shit.
CLYDE bursts in the door. He is wearing two gunbelts crossed,
with a holster on each side. Since he has only one arm, he
carries one pistol butt forward and the other butt back.
CLYDE
You boys clean my Remington?

FATTY

Cleaned an' loaded.
CHARLEY

Ha. He was building his fucking porch.
CHARLEY
Building his porch!
FATTY
If you was to get shot, Andy, would
you like it better to be a hot day
or...?
ANDY
(sharply)
I ain't gonna get shot.
CHARLEY

He's coming, ain't he?
CLYDE
(ejecting shells)
'Course he's coming.
FATTY
Hey, I just loaded her. Watcha doin'?
CLYDE
I don't trust nobody to load my guns,
not for a shootin'.
CHARLEY
What'd he say?
CLYDE
Little Bill? He didn't say nothin'.
Like I said, he was buildin' his
porch. Have you seen that thing?
FATTY
(sulking)
It was all loaded. Jesus, Clyde, you
got three pistols an' only one arm,
for Christ sake.

I just don' wanna get killed for
lack of shootin' back.
(to CHARLEY)
You know there ain't a straight angle
in that whole goddamn porch... or in
the whole house for that matter.
He's the worst fucking carpenter...
CHARLEY
(worried)
He didn't say nothin', huh?
CLYDE
(putting the third
pistol in his belt).)
Asked what they looked like, that's
all. Christ, maybe he's tough, but
he sure ain't no carpenter.
CHARLEY
Maybe he ain't so tough.
CLYDE looks up, surprised. There is a sudden silence.
ANDY
(blurting it)
He seem like... like he was... scared?
CLYDE
(amazed)
Little Bill? Him scared?
CHARLEY
We never seen him up against any...
like these ones... killers.
CLYDE
(looking at the
frightened faces of
CHARLEY and ANDY)
Little Bill come out of Kansas an'
Texas, boys. He worked them tough
towns.
CHARLEY

Just wondered. Anybody could be
scared.
ANDY drops his eyes and looks away from CLYDE.

No. He wasn't scared, boys. He just
ain't a good carpenter.
33 INT. BARBERSHOP -- DAY 33
ENGLISH BOB, delighting in the smooth feel of his freshly
shaved pink cheeks, climbs cheerfully out of the barber chair,
still chattering at the poor BARBER.
ENGLISH BOB
... can see that there's a dignity
in royalty... a majesty... that
precludes the likelihood of
assassination.
The BARBER is applying his little whisk broom to BOB's
waistcoat while w.w. pulls out his purse to make payment.
ENGLISH BOB
(continuing)
Why, if you were to point a pistol
at a King or a Queen, sir, I can
assure you your hand would shake as
though palsied...
BARBER
(looking at BOB's
pistols)
I wouldn't point no pistol at nobody,
sir.
ENGLISH BOB
(putting on his frock
coat over his guns)
A wise policy. But if you did, I can
assure you, the sight of royalty
would cause you to dismiss all
thoughts of bloodshed and stand...
in awe.
(pause)
Whereas, a president... I mean why
not shoot a president?
The BARBER doesn't know how to take this guy, and just ogles
him.
ENGLISH BOB
Now this Strawberry Alice person,
tell me again.

Just ask for Alice and say you want
a game of billiards.
ENGLISH BOB

Billiards, eh? Even though I don't
really wish to play?
BARBER
Don't matter. They burned the table
in '78 for firewood.
ENGLISH BOB
Ah, I see.
W.W. has already stepped out and ENGLISH BOB follows him out
the door.
34 EXT. BARBERSHOP/MAIN STREET -- DAY 34
ENGLISH BOB steps out the door.
ENGLISH BOB
Come on, W.W. Let's...
Something's wrong! There is a funny quiet and W.W. is frozen
like a ramrod. ENGLISH BOB turns around.
ANGLE ON CHARLEY HECKER
Ten yards to BOB's right, pointing a 12-gauge shotgun, and
FATTY ROSSITER a few feet away, pointing his old Enfield.
ANGLE ON ANDY RUSSELL
On BOB's left, pale and tense, pointing his Henry, and CLYDE
LEDBETTER kneeling near him, leveling one of his pistols.
ANGLE ON LITTLE BILL
Standing ten yards away in the empty dusty street where the
Fourth of July flags are flapping.
LITTLE BILL
Hullo, Bob. Boys, this here is English
Bob.
ENGLISH BOB
(under his breath)
Shit and fried eggs.
(CONTINUED)
41.
34 CONTINUED: 34
LITTLE BILL
Been a long time, Bob. You run out
of Chinamen?
ENGLISH BOB
(recovering his
composure)
Little Bill, I thought you were dead.
I see you shaved off your chin
whiskers.
LITTLE BILL
(feeling his chin)
Well, I was always tasting the soup
two hours after I et it.
ANGLE ON STREET
Empty, silent.
ANGLE ON FACES
In the window of the Blue Bottle restaurant. EGGS ANDERSON,
TOM LUCKINBILL, MRS. PEEVEY, HOPPITY THOMAS, peering out.
ANGLE ON ALICE, KATE, AND LITTLE SUE
In Greely's window and, in the open doorway, ready to duck
for cover, SKINNY and GERMANY JOE SCHULTZ and PADDY MCGEE,
the cooper.
ANGLE ON ENGLISH BOB
ENGLISH BOB
What I heard was that you fell off
your horse drunk and broke your neck.
LITTLE BILL
I heard that one myself, Bob. Hell,
I even thought I was dead till I
found out it was just I was in
Nebraska.
(pause)
Who's your friend?
ENGLISH BOB
W.W. Beauchamp... Little Bill Daggett
and... "friends."
W.W.
(nervous)
From N-n-newton?... and H-hays, and
A-a-bilene?
(CONTINUED)
42.
34 CONTINUED: (2) 34
ENGLISH BOB
(dryly)
The same.
CHARLEY is taking all this in, wide-eyed.
LITTLE BILL
You work for the railroads, too, Mr.
Beauchamp?
W.W.
(scared to death).)
N-no. I wr-wr-wr-write... I wr-wrwrite...
LITTLE BILL
Letters?
ENGLISH BOB
Books. He's my biographer.
LITTLE BILL
(fighting amazement)
Oh.
And W.W. is reaching for a pocket.
ANGLE ON ANDY, CHARLEY, CLYDE AND FATTY
Tensing to fire.
ANGLE ON ENGLISH BOB
ENGLISH BOB
I wouldn't do it, W.W.
W.W. freezes, terrified... and a puddle of urine forms at
his feet.
W.W.
It's o-only a b-b-b-book...
LITTLE BILL
(his pistol half-drawn)
A book, huh?
(returning his pistol
and glancing at the
piss)
I guess that means you can read...
An' I guess you boys seen them signs
about surrendering your firearms...
But then, like you told old Andy
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
43.
34 CONTINUED: (3) 34
LITTLE BILL (CONT'D)
there, you ain't armed, are you,
Bob?
ENGLISH BOB
Not really...
(shrugging)
Maybe a couple of Peacemakers...
(bargaining)
I imagine you could overlook those,
eh, Bill? If you didn't see them...
or hear them?
LITTLE BILL
(cold as ice)
I guess not, Bob. I don't like guns
around.
With a sardonic glance at the arsenal trained on him, ENGLISH
BOB gives a shrug and holds open his coat in surrender,
exposing two fancy holstered pistols.
LITTLE BILL gives ANDY a head signal and ANDY steps forward
and takes the pistols from ENGLISH BOB's holsters.
LITTLE BILL
Charley, see what sort of "books"
Mr. Beauchamp is packing... but watch
you don't get wet.
ENGLISH BOB
(to ANDY)
Be careful with those, sonny.
Onlookers are stepping out of doorways now and moving timidly
into the street, forming a large semicircle. The whores are
among them.
CHARLEY
No shit, Little Bill, all he's got
is this here book.
CHARLEY holds up a dime novel with a lurid cover showing a
gentleman in a top hat protecting a woman with his body while
firing two pistols at seven disheveled "Western-types." The
title is The Duke of Death.
LITTLE BILL
(reading with effort)
The... Duck of Death.
W.W.
D-d-d-duke. The D-d-duke of Death.
(CONTINUED)
44.
34 CONTINUED: (4) 34
ENGLISH BOB starts to go but LITTLE BILL puts a hand on his
shoulder.
LITTLE BILL
Give me the .32, Bob.
Furious, ENGLISH BOB turns and looks into BILL's eyes and
then, seeing no alternative, opens his vest, exposing a small
pistol.
ENGLISH BOB
You leave me at the mercy of my
enemies.
LITTLE BILL
(taking the pistol)
Enemies, Bob? You been talking about
the Queen again? On Independence
Day?
A lot of the tension has gone out of the occasion and the
CROWD is beginning to murmur and PEOPLE are starting to move
and a couple of KIDS are running when suddenly...
Crunch! ENGLISH BOB's face seems to cave in with the force
of LITTLE BILL's fist and BOB literally flies backward and
slams into the side of the barbershop.
ANGLE ON ALICE, ANDY, LITTLE SUE, CHARLEY
ALICE gasping... ANDY's jaw drops... LITTLE SUE's eyes
bulge... CHARLEY gulps.
ANGLE ON ENGLISH BOB
Slumped against the wall, blood pouring from his unhinged
jaw, amazed.
ENGLISH BOB
Wh... what...?
LITTLE BILL walks calmly up to him and Wham... kicks him
hard in the chest.
ANGLE ON SILKY, MRS. PEEVEY, EGGS, ALICE
SILKY, having a hard time swallowing, and MRS. PEEVEY turning
away and EGGS, horrified, and ALICE'S scared face.
(CONTINUED)
45.
34 CONTINUED: (5) 34
ANGLE ON ENGLISH BOB
Bloody, on all fours, pulling a knife from his waistcoat...
but the whole effort is painful and hopeless. He hasn't a
chance.
LITTLE BILL looks down at him for a moment from his enormous
height, watching the smaller man's pitiful effort, then,
Slam!... LITTLE BILL kicks him in the ribs hard and you can
hear air going out of BOB, and BILL steps hard on BOB's knife
hand and the bones crunch loudly.
ANGLE ON W.W. AND ANDY
W.W., white as a ghost and ANDY is trying not to vomit. There
is the sound of another brutal blow.
ANGLE ON ENGLISH BOB
ENGLISH BOB on all fours in the dusty street now, barely
conscious.
Ka-whump! LITTLE BILL kicks him again, not angrily, but hard.
LITTLE BILL
I guess you think I'm kickin' you,
Bob... but it ain't so.
(wham, another kick)
What I'm doin' is talkin', hear? I'm
talkin' to all them villains down in
Kansas an' them villains in Cheyenne.
(whump). Lettin' em know there ain't no whores' gold...
LITTLE BILL turns and looks hard at the whores and ALICE is
sick from the violence and LITTLE SUE is biting her lip and
SILKY has tears in her eyes.
LITTLE BILL
(turning his back to
BOB and kicking him)
... an' how if there was... how they
wouldn't want to come lookin' for it
anyhow.
LITTLE BILL looks down with eyes as cold as ice and ENGLISH
BOB grovels in the bloody dust, barely conscious.
35 EXT. OPEN COUNTRY -- DAY 35
Open country under a hot sun and MUNNY and NED riding their
horses at a walk and the saddles creaking and birds chirping
in the five-foot-high grass.
(CONTINUED)
46.
35 CONTINUED: 35
It is late morning in Northern Kansas and they have been
riding since dawn, mostly in silence, but NED has something
on his mind and he glances at MUNNY and frowns and then
finally he blurts his question.
NED
Say, Bill... You ever... ever go
into town... an' all?
MUNNY
(surprised at the
question)
Sure, I got to. Got to get supplies.
NED
No. I mean...
(embarrassed)
... an' get yourself a woman? You
know?
MUNNY looks away quickly, embarrassed, and it seems like he
isn't going to answer, and then, when he finally does, he
keeps his eyes on the horizon.
MUNNY
Naw. Naw, I don't ever go into town
for that.
(pause)
A man like me... A man like me. can't
get no woman but one he's gonna pay
for... an' that ain't right... buyin'
flesh.
(looking at NED)
Claudia, God rest her soul, she
wouldn't have wanted me doin' nothin'
like that, me bein' a father, an'
all.
He looks away again.
NED
(rhetorically)
Whaddaya do, just use your hand?
MUNNY
(after a nervous glance
at NED)
Sometimes... yeah.
(looking at horizon)
I don't miss it all that much.
NED is shaking his head, wondering at the transformation of
his old friend when...
(CONTINUED)
47.
35 CONTINUED: (2) 35
Crack! A rifle shot and the albino mare rears violently,
whinnying and hurling MUNNY out of the saddle and...
NED's roan bolts at full speed, NED barely staying aboard.
Crack! Another shot.
ANGLE ON MUNNY
On all fours in the tall grass. He feels his forehead and
wipes away a little blood, and shakes his head to clear it.
Then he hears rustling in the long grass and he whirls and
pulls the Starr out of his belt, and sitting back, he aims
at where he heard the noise and he pulls back the hammer
with a loud Click.
NED (O.S.)
(a whisper)
Billy. Billy.
MUNNY
(lowering the pistol,
relieved))
Yeah.
NED crawls out of the grass next to MUNNY.
NED
Some fucker's shootin' at us.
MUNNY
Yeah.
NED
(alarmed, seeing blood)
He hit you?
MUNNY
Naw. I bumped my head fallin' off of
my horse.
Crack, another shot. NED looks puzzled and he lifts his head
up and tries to look around without exposing himself.
A hundred yards away, NED can see a clump of four or five
trees and there is a little cloud of black smoke still hanging
in the air there and then a sudden flash of fire, smoke and
crack!
NED doesn't even duck, he just frowns.
(CONTINUED)
48.
35 CONTINUED: (3) 35
NED
He ain't shootin' our way no more.
(indicating the left)
He's shootin' over that way. Who's
he shootin' at over that way?
MUNNY
Beats the hell out of me.
NED
You suppose maybe we're in somebody's
field?
MUNNY
I didn't see nothin' planted.
Crack. Another shot. NED ducks urgently.
NED
Fuck, he's shootin' at us again.
Crack, Crack, Crack.
NED
(continuing)
Jesus, he's shootin' up the whole
fucking horizon.
MUNNY is thinking about it, has an idea, weighs it and gives
it a try.
MUNNY
(shouting)
Hey!
NED
You're marking us, Billy.
MUNNY
(ignoring him)
Hey, Kid.
NED
Kid? The Kid's shootin' at us?
MUNNY
Is that you, Kid?
NED
Why would The Kid shoot at us?
MUNNY
Hey, Kid. it's me, Bill Munny.
49.
36 EXT. TREES -- DAY 36
THE KID, rifle at his cheek, is crouched behind one of the
trees. His horse is standing nearby.
MUNNY (O.S.)
Hey, Kid, is that you? It's me, Bill
Munny.
THE KID is frowning and finally he makes up his mind.
THE KID
(houting)
Yeah. It's me.
MUNNY (O.S.)
Don't shoot at us no more, okay?
THE KID is peering around the tree and squinting ferociously.
HIS POV -- THE FIELD
It is one big blur. He can't see worth a shit.
THE KID
Squinting and peering and worrying.
THE KID
Who you got with you?
MUNNY (O.S.)
Ned Logan. My old partner, Ned Logan.
Don't you shoot no more, hear?
THE KID doesn't like it, he's nervous and twitching, trying
desperately to see what's going on out there.
MUNNY (O.S.)
We're gonna collect our horses an'
come on over. You ain't gonna shoot
no more, are you?
THE KID
No, I ain't.
37 EXT. TREES -- ANGLE ON MUNNY -- DAY 37
Bedraggled and sweaty, walking into the clump of trees leading
his horse, and NED, behind him, leading his roan and looking
just as bad.
MUNNY
Had to chase the damn horse a mile.
(CONTINUED)
50.
37 CONTINUED: 37
THE KID is sitting under the shade tree looking sullen.
NED
(angry)
What was you shootin' at us for,
anyhow?
THE KID
Thought you was followin' me.
MUNNY
Well, we was. Like you said, I changed
my mind an'...
THE KID
Wasn't nothin' said about no partner.
MUNNY
Well, this here's Ned Logan... Ned,
this here's the Schofield Kid, nephew
of Pete Sothow an'...
THE KID
I seen two fellas followin' me, I
guessed they come to kill me.
(pause)
We didn't talk about no other fella.
MUNNY
(squatting in front
of THE KID, talking
in a persuasive tone)
Well now, Kid, there's two of these
cowboys, ain't that so? Better there's
three of us... maybe them cowboys
got friends. Maybe...
THE KID
I was gonna kill them two by myself.
It don't take three.
NED walks over to where THE KID's rifle is leaning against
the tree and THE KID is watching nervously.
MUNNY
Now Ned's a hell of a shot with a
rifle. Hell, he can hit a bird in
the eye, flyin'.
(CONTINUED)
51.
37 CONTINUED: (2) 37
NED
(picking up THE KID's
rifle)
Better'n you anyhow, Kid. You wasn't
comin' close.
THE KID
Keep your damn hands offa that rifle,
mister.
THE KID is touching his pistol and NED puts the rifle down,
annoyed.
NED
I was only checkin' it for you.
Thought maybe somethin' was bent.
THE KID
Nothin's bent.
NED
Well, you was shootin' every which
way an'...
THE KID
(to MUNNY)
You gonna share your half with him?
MUNNY
Three ways, I figured.
THE KID
No.
MUNNY
(to NED)
Sorry, Ned. Guess I wasted your time.
See ya, Kid!
MUNNY turns to go and NED gives THE KID a disgusted look and
turns away.
THE KID
(to MUNNY)
You're goin' back with him?
MUNNY
(turning)
He's my partner. He don't go, I don't.
NED is mounted and MUNNY starts to mount, too, but the mare
is as reluctant as ever, shying and prancing while MUNNY
hops awkwardly with one foot in the stirrup.
(CONTINUED)
52.
37 CONTINUED: (3) 37
THE KID
What's it come to, three ways?
MUNNY turns and looks at THE KID.
38 EXT. OPEN COUNTRY -- DAY 38
The three of them riding across open country. THE KID looks
like he still has a thorn up his ass and the only sound is
the creaking of saddles.
Storm clouds are gathering behind them on the horizon.
MUNNY
Oh, shit.
And THE KID looks back, but of course he can't figure out
what it is they saw.
THE KID
What the hell are you pissin' about,
I'd like to know?
MUNNY
(astonished)
Huh?
THE KID
Well, what were you lookin' at,
anyhow?
MUNNY
Lookin' at?
NED
Clouds, Kid. We was lookin' at them
clouds on account of we got a storm
ridin' up our ass.
THE KID
(looking back)
Oh, them.
(petulantly)
Hell, I seen them.
NED frowns and looks at THE KID and something is bothering
NED.
39 EXT. STREAMBED -- DAY 39
A dry streambed and the three men are riding single file now
with THE KID in the lead but NED has been thinking and,
trotting his horse, he pulls alongside THE KID.
(CONTINUED)
53.
39 CONTINUED: 39
NED
You was right to change your mind,
Kid.
THE KID
(surly, suspicious)
Yeah?
NED
(proudly)
I'm a damn good shot.
(looking up)
See that hawk up there? I could kill
that hawk with one shot.
ANGLE ON EMPTY SKY
There isn't any hawk.
ANGLE ON MUNNY
who is right behind them, looking up, and he doesn't see any
hawk and he looks at NED like he thought NED was crazy and
he frowns.
THE KID just looks up and squints and looks ahead at the
trail and keeps riding.
THE KID
Hell, I could hit it, too, if I didn't
mind wastin' a shot.
And MUNNY looks up again, amazed, because they must be crazy,
both of them.
And NED reins his horse hard.
NED
There ain't no hawk up there, Kid.
And THE KID reins and turns and he locks eyes with NED. He
knows he's been found out.
NED
(continuing)
Can't see worth a shit, can you?
THE KID is furious, his eyes flick around and he spots
something and he pulls out the Schofield.
THE KID
See them fucking turtles?
(CONTINUED)
54.
39 CONTINUED: (2) 39
ANGLE ON THREE TURTLES
making their way up the streambed ten yards away.
ANGLE ON THE KID
His Schofield spitting fire and smoke. Blam, blam.
ANGLE ON TURTLE
Blam, the third turtle exploding and following the other two
to oblivion.
ANGLE ON MEN
MUNNY
(impressed)
Shit.
NED
(impressed, but holding
back)
How far kin you see?
THE KID
Far enough.
NED
We ain't goin' to Nebraska on no
turtle hunt. A hundred yards?
THE KID
More.
NED
(testing)
See that scrub oak yonder?
THE KID
(furious)
Fuck you.
NED
(to MUNNY)
He's blind, for Chri...
THE KID
(pointing his pistol
at NED)
I ain't blind, you asshole.
(CONTINUED)
55.
39 CONTINUED: (3) 39
MUNNY
Now hold on, boys, hold on. Now,
Kid, you kin see fifty yards, can't
you?
THE KID
Bet your ass I kin see fifty yards
an' I kin shoot this son of a bitch...
MUNNY
Easy, Kid, easy...
(looking NED in the
eye)
Now, you hear that, Ned? The kid can
see fifty yards fine, hear?
NED
(under his breath)
Jesus.
MUNNY
Fifty yards ain't bad.
(glancing at horizon)
Guess we better get along.
ANGLE ON SKY -- DAY
Storm clouds building behind them on the horizon.
40 INT. COUNTY OFFICE -- CLOSE ON BOOK -- NIGHT 40
The lurid cover, The Duke of Death by W.W. BEAUCHAMP. Widen.
LITTLE BILL is looking at the cover, his feet propped on his
desk in the county office. It is night and the office is lit
with an oil lamp.
LITTLE BILL
(referring to the
book)
Them boys look like real hard cases.
Did you kill all seven of 'em dead,
Bob... or did you just wing some of
'em?
ENGLISH BOB is lying on his back on a cot in the little cell
a few feet away. He turns his head toward LITTLE BILL and
his swollen face is horrible to behold. Of course, he doesn't
answer except with the nasty eye.
LITTLE BILL
(continuing)
That is you there, ain't it, Bob?
The Duck of Death?
(CONTINUED)
56.
40 CONTINUED: 40
W.W.
(daring)
Uh... Duke.
W.W. is in the little cell next to ENGLISH BOB'S.
LITTLE BILL
Oh, yeah... Duke. Well, Bob, you
always was hell an' Jesus with a
pistol... but seven of 'em, an' you
protectin' the lady, too... How'd
you do it?
ENGLISH BOB just turns his malignant stare away but screws
up his courage and asserts himself... sort of.
W.W.
Uh... It's... uh... generally
considered desirable in the publishing
business to... ah... take certain
license in depicting the cover
scene... for... ah... purposes
involving the... ah, marketplace.
LITTLE BILL
Well, Mr. Beauchamp... from what I
read of this here book, I'd have to
say the writin' ain't a whole lot
different from the pitcher.
W.W.
(sweating, but with
dignity)
Uh... I can assure you, Mr. Daggett...
the events described within are
based... on the accounts of
eyewitnesses and...
LITTLE BILL
(opening the book)
Meaning the duck himself, I guess.
W.W.
Duke.
LITTLE BILL
(harshly)
Duck, I says.
(reading badly)
"You have insulted the honor of this
beautiful woman, Corcoran," said the
duck. "You must apologize."
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
57.
40 CONTINUED: (2) 40
LITTLE BILL (CONT'D)
But Two Gun Corcoran would have none
of it and, cursing, he reachedfor
his pistols and would have killed
them but The Duck was faster and hot
lead blazed from his smoking sixguns."
He tosses the book on the desk, disgusted.
W.W.
(with dignity)
I believe that to be an accurate
description of the events, sir...
Albeit, there is a certain poetry to
the language which...
LITTLE BILL
(standing up)
Well, Mr. Beauchamp, I was at the
Blue Bottle Saloon in Wichita the
night English Bob killed Corky
Corcoran... an' I didn't see you
there... nor no woman, nor no twogun shooters, nor nothin' like that.
W.W.
(amazed)
You were there?
W.W. looks to ENGLISH BOB for confirmation but BOB's stare
just gets nastier.
LITTLE BILL is warming to the subject, though, standing in
front of the cell.
LITTLE BILL
First off... Corky didn't carry two
pistols, though he should of.
W.W.
But he was called...
LITTLE BILL
Some folks did call Old Corky, "Two
Gun" but not because he was sportin'
two pistols, but because he had a
dick so big it was longer than the
barrel on that Walker Colt he carried.
An' the only insultin' he done was
stickin' that big dick of his in
some French lady that Old Bob was
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
58.
40 CONTINUED: (3) 40
LITTLE BILL (CONT'D)
sweet on,... Well, one day Corky
walked into the Blue Bottle and before
he knows what's happening, Bob takes
a shot at him... and misses on account
of he's drunker than hell.
W.W. is fascinated and he looks to BOB and BOB's eye is
blazing and he looks back at LITTLE BILL who is beginning to
act out the scene.
LITTLE BILL
(continuing)
Well, that bullet whizzin' by panicked
Corky, an' he done the wrong thing!
Pulled his gun in such a damn hurry
he shot off his own toe. Meantime,
Bob aims good and squeezes off
another... but he's so drunk he misses
again an' hits the thousand-dollar
mirror behind the bar. Well, now the
Duck of Death is good as dead 'cause
this time Corky does right an' aims
real good, no hurry...
W.W.
(beside himself)
And?
LITTLE BILL
Bam! That Walker Colt blew up in his
hand... which was a failing common
to that model. Now if Corky would
have really had two guns instead of
just a big dick, he could have
defended himself to the end.
W.W.
You... you mean...
(looking at BOB)
English Bob killed him while...?
LITTLE BILL
Well, he wasn't gonna wait for Corky
to grow no new hand. He walked over
real close, bein' drunk, an' shot
him through the liver.
W.W. stares first at ENGLISH BOB and then at LITTLE BILL,
appalled.
59.
41 EXT. WOODS -- NIGHT 41
Night in the woods and NED, fussing around with his blankets
not far from the camp fire.
NED
(irritably)
No sir, I did not give up robbin'
an' stealin' on account of I got
religion. I give it up 'cause I got
too old for all this here nature.
MUNNY is lying in his blankets a few feet away, exhausted
and-dirty and not a bit interested in NED's complaints.
NED
(continuing)
I give it up 'cause I hate sleepin'
out in the air... fuckin' sticks in
my food... an' fuckin' bugs in my
food... an' fuckin' rocks under my
back...
(crawling into the
blankets)
... Shit, I sure do miss my fuckin'
bed.
MUNNY
(irritably).)
Yeah... you said that last night.
NED
Last night I said I missed my fuckin'
wife... tonight I just miss my fuckin'
bed.
Lightning flashes and a horse whinnies and then the thunder
cracks and rolls.
MUNNY
Well, I guess you're gonna miss your
fuckin' roof soon enough.
Horses -- Night The horses, shying and skittish, and THE KID
is rubbing his face tenderly on the Morgan and whispering in
a soothing voice.
42 EXT. CAMP -- NIGHT 42
MUNNY and NED lying near the campfire and THE KID walks up
and starts to fix his blankets.
(CONTINUED)
60.
42 CONTINUED: 42
He looks at MUNNY thoughtfully. Something's bothering him,
and finally he blurts it out as he climbs into his own
blankets.
THE KID
Say, Bill. That business in Jackson
County... did that really happen? I
mean how they say it happened?
MUNNY
What business?
THE KID
(a frown, a pause,
then)
An' how there was two deputies up
close pointin' rifles at you... had
you dead to rights... an' how you
pulled out a pistol an' blew them
both away to hell... an' only took a
scratch yourself.
(pause)
Uncle Pete told me he never seen
nothin' like it, shootin' your way
out of a scrape like that.
MUNNY
(uncomfortable). Well... I don't
recollect.
THE KID
(amazed and dubious)
You don't recollect!
THE KID doesn't know whether he's been rebuffed or what, but
seeing after a moment that his conversation with MUNNY is
not getting anywhere he decides to have a try at NED.
THE KID
(continuing)
Say, Ned...?
NED
(curt)
Yeah.
THE KID
How many men you killed?
(after a long pause)
Ain't you gonna answer?
NED
I don't like the question.
(CONTINUED)
61.
42 CONTINUED: (2) 42
THE KID
(indignant)
Well, I gotta know what kind of fellas
I'm ridin' with, don't I? In case of
a scrape.
NED
How many you killed, Kid?
THE KID
Five. I killed five of 'em.
(pause)
That counts a Mexican I killed.
(pause)
He come at me with a knife.
There is a long pause and then a flash of lightning and a
roll of thunder and the nervous whinnies of the horses.
MUNNY
Get some sleep, Kid.
THE KID
You boys are crotchety as a couple
of hens.
Just then the rain starts and it sizzles in the camp fire
and the horses snort and NED covers his head with his
blankets.
NED
Aw, shit!
43 INT. COUNTY OFFICE -- NIGHT 43
W.W.
Actually, then, Mr. Corcoran was
faster on the draw than the D...
English Bob?
W.W. is sitting at LITTLE BILL's desk writing furiously with
a quill pen. It is still night and LITTLE BILL is lounging
in a chair and ENGLISH BOB is moaning and snoring in the
cell.
LITTLE BILL
Faster? Fast was his mistake. If he
hadn't been in such a goddamn hurry
he would not have shot off his toe
with his first shot and he would
have killed old Bob.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
62.
43 CONTINUED: 43
LITTLE BILL (CONT'D)
(lecturing)
See, son, bein' a good shot an' bein'
quick with a pistol... that don't do
no harm... but it ain't much next to
bein' cool.
LITTLE BILL pulls out his pistol very deliberately... not
slowly, but not like a Hollywood fast-draw.
LITTLE BILL
(continuing)
A man who will keep his head an' not
get rattled under fire... he will
kill you like as not.
LITTLE BILL is pointing his pistol, aiming.
W.W.
But if the other fellow is quicker
and fires first...
LITTLE BILL
He will be hurryin' and he will miss.
That there is as fast as I can pull
an' aim an' hit anythin' more'n ten
feet away... unless it's a barn.
W.W.
But... if he doesn't miss?
LITTLE BILL
(laughing and
holstering his pistol)
Then he will kill you.
That is why there are so few dangerous
men like old Bob there... an' like
me. It ain't so easy to shoot a man,
anyhow... an' if the son of a bitch
is shootin' back at you... well,
it'll unnerve most fellas.
(struck with an idea)
Look here, let me show you somethin'.
(He reaches into a
drawer in the desk
and pulls out a
pistol.)
See this here pistol?
W.W. looks at the pistol uneasily and over in the cell ENGLISH
BOB's one eye opens and he moves his head slightly because
he senses something is happening.
(CONTINUED)
63.
43 CONTINUED: (2) 43
LITTLE BILL holds the pistol out to W.W.
LITTLE BILL
(continuing)
Take it.
(as W.W. hesitates)
Go on, take a hold.
Nervously W.W. accepts the gun as though it were hot. LITTLE
BILL pulls some keys out of a drawer and tosses them on the
desk.
LITTLE BILL
(continuing)
Them's the keys. All you gotta do is
shoot me an' you an' English Bob can
ride out free as birds.
W.W.
(shaking)
Is... is it... loaded?
LITTLE BILL
Wouldn't be no good if it wasn't.
You got to cock it, though.
W.W. looks nervously over at ENGLISH BOB and BOB's eye says,
"Do it, do it, do it."
W.W. gulps and he pulls back the hammer and stands up and
looks at BOB again and BOB is nodding "Yes, yes, do it."
LITTLE BILL
(continuing)
An' you got to point it.
(pause)
Go on, point it.
Slowly, with trembling hand, W.W. raises the gun and points
it at LITTLE BILL, who looks calmly back at him.
LITTLE BILL
(continuing)
All you gotta do is pull on the
trigger, mister.
W.W. gulps and sweat comes off his forehead and he points
the shaking gun and BOB nods "yes" and W.W. bites his lip
and then...
W.W. lowers the gun slowly. He can't do it. He wipes his
forehead.
(CONTINUED)
64.
43 CONTINUED: (3) 43
LITTLE BILL
(continuing)
Hot, ain't it?
(reaching for the gun)
You never even put your finger on
the trigger.
LITTLE BILL is reaching for the pistol but W.W. has a
frightening idea and instead of giving up the pistol he steps
backward toward the cell.
W.W.
What if... what if I gave it to...
him.
And he indicates BOB.
LITTLE BILL's eyes narrow like slits and tension fills the
air.
LITTLE BILL
Go ahead... give it to him.
ENGLISH BOB's eye lights up with anticipation and he tries
to get up on one elbow.
W.W.
(gulping).)
R-r-r-really? You r-r-really w-wwant...?
LITTLE BILL
(like ice)
Give it to him.
ENGLISH BOB is sitting up and reaching for the gun and his
eye is on LITTLE BILL and W.W. reaches out with a shaking
hand and ENGLISH BOB's hand just touches the gun and...
LITTLE BILL drops his right hand to his own gun and grips
the butt and...
ENGLISH BOB hesitates, his gaze locked with LITTLE BILL's
and the two men eye each other. Then, furious, ENGLISH BOB
withdraws his hand... empty.
LITTLE BILL
(continuing; grinning))
Guess he don't want it, Mr. Beauchamp.
LITTLE BILL accepts the pistol from the trembling W.W. and,
looking straight into ENGLISH BOB's angry eye, LITTLE BILL
ejects five cartridges from the chambers of the pistol.
(CONTINUED)
65.
43 CONTINUED: (4) 43
LITTLE BILL
(continuing)
You was right not to take it, Bob. I
would've killed you.
W.W. collapses into a chair and wipes sweat from his brow.
LITTLE BILL (O.S.)
We could use some rain, eh, Mr.
Beauchamp?
44 EXT. CAMP -- DAY 44
Barrrrroom! Thunder, lightning, rain in sheets and the albino
mare rearing and screaming and MUNNY landing in the mud.
MUNNY
You fucking no-good goddamn shitfaced pig fucking dirty whore.
It is daylight but the rain is so thick you can't see more
than five feet and MUNNY crawls up out of the mud wearing a
slicker and looking like hell, already full of remorse for
his outburst.
NED rides up out of the rain leading MUNNY's horse and MUNNY
tries to mount again.
MUNNY
(continuing)
I didn't mean it, old gal.
The albino rears, but NED is helping and he holds the horse
and grabs the seat of MUNNY's muddy pants and half shoves
him into the saddle.
Up ahead, barely visible in the rain, THE KID is holding
back his horse impatiently.
THE KID
Let's go.
45 EXT. OPEN COUNTRY -- DAY (LITTLE LATER) (RAIN) 45
NED and MUNNY riding side by side through the downpour and
THE KID twenty yards ahead, barely visible. MUNNY looks like
shit and NED looks at him with concern, deliberates, then
reaches into his saddlebag and pulls out a bottle of whiskey
and offers it.
(CONTINUED)
66.
45 CONTINUED: 45
NED
I brung this for when we had to kill
them fellows.
(as MUNNY glances at
it and looks away)
I guess we could use some now.
MUNNY
Not for me. I don't touch it no more.
NED
(exasperated)
God damn it, Bill, it's rainin'.
MUNNY
I know it's rainin'.
(looking ahead)
Give The Kid a drink, why dontcha?
NED takes a long pull on the bottle, recorks it, and puts it
in his saddlebag. He looks sympathetically at his friend
hunched unhappily in his saddle.
NED
You think The Kid really killed five
men?
MUNNY just shrugs and looks back at the trail and keeps
riding.
MUNNY
(after a while)
No.
NED
What he was talkin' about... how
them deputies had the drop on you
an' Pete...
MUNNY
Yeah?
NED
I remember how there was three of
them deputies you shot... not two.
MUNNY
(dismissing it)
Well, I ain't like that no more,
Ned. I ain't no crazy, killin' fool.
(CONTINUED)
67.
45 CONTINUED: (2) 45
NED
(after a while)
You still think it'll be easy shootin'
them cowboys?
MUNNY shrugs and looks straight ahead into the rain. Of
course, it won't be easy... and they both know it.
MUNNY
If we don't drown first.
46 EXT. MAIN STREET -- DAY 46
A blazing hot day and ENGLISH BOB's battered face staring
out of the mud wagon which is being loaded up by CHANDLER.
In the distance the train whistle toots eagerly.
LITTLE BILL
(to CHANDLER)
Give them keys to the conductor and
tell him he can loose the cuffs off
of Bob soon as he's out of the county.
LITTLE BILL is standing beside the mud wagon and W.W. is
standing next to him and a little knot of onlookers forms a
semicircle.
ENGLISH BOB
(talking through closed
teeth)
Mmmm pistols.
LITTLE BILL
Oh, yeah.
LITTLE BILL unwraps a cloth and produces the ivory-handled
peace-makers... smashed and hopelessly bent. And he gives
them to BOB and looks him in his one furious eye.
LITTLE BILL
(continuing)
I guess you know, Bob, how if I see
you again I'll just start shootin'
right off an' figure it's selfdefense.
That's fine with ENGLISH BOB. He glares back and the two men
understand each other perfectly and then CHANDLER whips the
horses and the wagon starts to roll.
(CONTINUED)
68.
46 CONTINUED: 46
LITTLE BILL
(continuing)
I ain't stealin' your biographer,
Bob. Stayin' on was his idea.
And W.W. stands there beside LITTLE BILL and gives BOB a
shit-eating look and ENGLISH BOB just glares and rolls away.
47 EXT. MAIN STREET -- MOMENTS LATER 47
As the mud wagon rattles down the dusty street, ENGLISH BOB
sticks his horrid swollen face out the window and screams
insanely:
ENGLISH BOB
A plague on you! A plague on the
whole stinking lot of you! You're
uncivilized vermin, without laws or
morals! You're worthless savages! I
curse you! You're cursed! Cursed!
The WHORES, fanning themselves on Greely's porch, stare
dumbfounded as the madman rolls by raving. Then he's gone.
All that remains is the sound of his ranting, diminishing in
the distance and a cloud of dust settling on the hot street.
Sitting next to FAITH on the porch, ALICE fans herself grimly.
ALICE
Nobody's gonna come.
FAITH
Huh?
ALICE
After what Little Bill done to the
Englishman.
SKINNY steps out the door and blinks in the dazzling light
and wipes his face.
SKINNY
Delilah, them tables ain't clean.
Can't you get 'em clean?
DELILAH gets up and goes in, angrily brushing past SKINNY in
the doorway.
(CONTINUED)
69.
47 CONTINUED: 47
SKINNY
(continuing; after
her)
Well, if you'd cover up your face,
maybe somebody'd want to fuck with
you an' you wouldn't have to do all
the cleanin'.
(to the others)
Whaddaya call them things that cover
the face?
FAITH
(looking straight
ahead)
A veil.
SKINNY
Yeah, a veil. Christ, it's hot.
There is a distant roll of thunder and SKINNY looks off at
the southern horizon, where storm clouds are gathering.
ALICE
(listlessly)
Rain's coming.
SKINNY
(emphatically)
Thank God.
48 EXT. TRAIN TRACKS -- DAY 48
Thunder and lightning and the train chugging through the
storm. A second flash of lightning reveals three drenched
riders near the tracks and one of them is having trouble
controlling his white horse.
Of course it is MUNNY and as he tries to hold the shying
mare a flash of lightning lights up a passing railroad coach
and MUNNY gets just a glimpse of a strange battered face in
the window.
THE KID is handing the whiskey bottle back to NED and NED
offers it to MUNNY again.
NED
You sure, Bill?
And MUNNY just shakes his head and wipes rain from his eyes.
70.
49 EXT. SOUTH ROAD -- NIGHT 49
Night and rain and THE KID is chuckling drunkenly and handing
the bottle back to NED who looks at it and tilts it way back.
They are riding along the South Road in the dark.
THE KID
(cheerfully)
I left you some... about a drop.
MUNNY is hunched in his saddle, shivering, his teeth
chattering.
NED
You all right, Bill?
MUNNY doesn't look all right. He looks like shit... looks
sick. He doesn't answer and NED looks worried and takes the
last drops from the bottle and tosses it in the road near
the ordinance sign, which is too dark to read.
50 INT. ALICE'S ROOM -- NIGHT 50
ALICE's room at night, the sound of rain beating hard on the
roof. ALICE is playing cards with SILKY and FAITH when LITTLE
SUE sticks her head in the door.
LITTLE SUE
A fella's askin' for you, Alice.
ALICE
Tonight? You ain't joshin'?
LITTLE SUE
(looking behind her)
This way, mister.
SILKY and FAITH pick up the cards to leave.
ALICE
Must be randy as hell to come out in
this shit.
And then they look up because a water-soaked young man with
very few front teeth and a ragged stubble is standing in the
doorway squinting. It is THE KID.
51 INT. LITTLE BILL'S HOUSE -- DAY 51
Drip, Drip, Drip. A chamber pot on the floor of LITTLE BILL's
house collecting water from a leak in the roof and LITTLE
BILL is walking about in stocking feet, making a speech.
(CONTINUED)
71.
51 CONTINUED: 51
LITTLE BILL
"No," he says, "you are wrong, Little
Bill. That there is no Curly J, but
a bobbed J." He had worked it over,
you see?
W.W. BEAUCHAMP is sitting in a chair scratching frantic notes
with a quill pen... and a splotch of water hits the paper
and he glances up because there is a new leak.
LITTLE BILL
(continuing; oblivious)
"Jim," I says, "You are a liar and a
horsethief." Now -- when he seen
them others wasn't gonna help him
none -- he started in to cryin' and
sobbin' and sayin'...
(mimicking)
... "Don't kill me, Little Bill,
don't kill me, please don't kill
me."
W.W. is trying to write and trying to slide away from the
leak without interrupting LITTLE BILL, who is delighting in
his own narration, oblivious to the new leak.
LITTLE BILL
(continuing; in his
own voice)
"Well, Jim," I says, "it makes me
sick to see a man struttin' around
and packin' two pistols an' a Henry
rifle and cryin' like a baby."
W.W.
Did you... kill him?
LITTLE BILL
No... but I can't abide them kind...
an' you will find a lot of them in
the saloons... tramps an' drunk
teamsters an' crazy miners... sportin'
pistols like they was bad men, but
not having no sand nor character...
not even bad character.
W.W. is really getting wet and he is moving the chair.
(CONTINUED)
72.
51 CONTINUED: (2) 51
LITTLE BILL
(continuing; on his
own wavelength)
I do not like assassins an' men of
low character like your friend English
Bob... but Bob ain't no coward who
will cry to your face an' then...
W.W.
Uh... Sheriff... Uh...
LITTLE BILL
Huh? Oh
(looking up sadly)
Another one, huh? Shit, I guess I'm
clean out of receptacles.
W.W.
(trying a joke with
effort)
Maybe you should... hang the
carpenter.
LITTLE BILL
(jaw dropping)
What?
W.W.
(uneasy)
Uh... hang the... uh... carpenter...
There is a sudden loud knocking on the door and BILL turns
and goes to the door.
LITTLE BILL
On a night like this? What the hell?
Opening the door he reveals CHARLIE HECKER, wearing a slicker
and shedding water like a waterfall.
CHARLEY
Three seedy-lookin' fellas come inta
town, Bill. They're down to Greely's
an' at least two of 'em got guns.
52 INT. BARROOM -- CLOSE ON WHISKEY BOTTLE -- NIGHT 52
NED is pouring the bright liquid into his glass and MUNNY is
mesmerized by the dazzling highlights. Pull back. The two of
them are sitting at a table in Greely's smoky, dimly lit
barroom and the rain is beating on the roof and there is a
checker game at a table fifteen feet away attended by GERMANY
JOE SCHULTZ, TOM LUCKINBILL, a FARMER, EGGS ANDERSON, the

52 CONTINUED: 52
local RESTAURATEUR, and PADDY MCGEE the cooper. All of them
are sneaking occasional, furtive glances at the strangers,
as is FATTY, who is talking to SKINNY at the bar.
NED
... in hell's takin' The Kid so long?
You suppose he...?
(seeing MUNNY)
... Jesus, Bill, you look like shit.
MUNNY looks dazed and shakes his head to clear it.
MUNNY
You ... you remember Eagle Hendershot?
NED
(startled)
Huh? Uh ... yeah.
MUNNY
I seen him.
NED
He's dead, Bill.
MUNNY
His head was all busted open so's
you could see the inside.
NED
Jesus, Bill, you got fever. Take a
drink, will you?
MUNNY
(ignoring NED)
Worms was comin' out.
NED
(getting up)
Listen, Bill, I'm gonna see what's
takin' The Kid so long. Must be he's
gettin' an advance offa them sportin'
ladies.
NED starts for the back room, then stops and goes back.
NED
(continuing)
Say, Bill... if I was to... take a
little while myself... I guess you...
I guess you... I guess you don't
want to come?
(CONTINUED)
74.
52 CONTINUED: (2) 52
MUNNY shakes his head no and, as NED departs for the billiard
room, MUNNY stares vacantly at the whiskey bottle.
LITTLE BILL (O.S.)
... Gimme your pistol, mister.
MUNNY
(looking up, startled)
Huh?
The big man in the dripping slicker is standing only ten
feet away... LITTLE BILL. And LITTLE BILL is looking at him.
MUNNY can feel everybody in the room staring at him.
LITTLE BILL
I says, "You'll want to give over
your pistol."
MUNNY can see CHARLEY moving slowly along the wall on the
left for position... and FATTY is over on the right, SKINNY
beside him... and W.W. is by the door shifting nervously and
the checker players are frozen in their seats and MUNNY can
feel them all ... watching him.
MUNNY
Uh, no. No, I ain't drunk.
LITTLE BILL
(almost friendly)
Ordinance says you got to turn in
your firearms to the county office
day or night. I guess you didn't
read it with the weather an' all.
MUNNY
(nervously).)
Well... uh... I... I ain't got no,
uh, firearms.
LITTLE BILL
(not friendly anymore)
Them friends of yours in the back,
they carryin' pistols?
MUNNY
I... dunno. I mean, I guess not. No,
they ain't carryin' no guns.
LITTLE BILL
You're spillin' your whiskey, mister.
MUNNY
Like I said, I...
(CONTINUED)
75.
52 CONTINUED: (3) 52
LITTLE BILL
What's your name?
MUNNY
Uh, William ... uh ... Hendershot.
LITTLE SUE looks timidly in from the billiard room, bites
her lip, and retreats quickly.
LITTLE BILL
Well, Mr. Hendershot, if I was to
call you a no good son of a bitch
an' a liar, an' if I was to say you
shit in your pants on account of a
cowardly soul... well, I guess then,
you would show me your pistol right
quick an' shoot me dead, ain't that
so?
MUNNY
(trapped)
I... I guess I might... but like I
said, I ain't armed.
LITTLE BILL pulls out his pistol and points it at MUNNY and
makes a little motion with the barrel that means "get up"
and MUNNY get up.
LITTLE BILL steps close to him and reaches out with his left
hand for MUNNY's coat, revealing the Starr tucked in his
belt.
LITTLE BILL
I guess you just carry it for snakes
an' such.
MUNNY
Uh... yeah. Yeah.
LITTLE BILL
(cold)
There ain't no snakes in here, Mr.
Hendershot.
MUNNY
Well, uh ... it ain't loaded.
LITTLE BILL takes the pistol out of MUNNY's belt and slowly
and deliberately ejects five cartridges and he looks at MUNNY,
who is sweating, and MUNNY just wants a way out.
(CONTINUED)
76.
52 CONTINUED: (4) 52
MUNNY
(continuing)
Well, the powder's wet an' ...
Whack! LITTLE BILL brings the muzzle of the gun across MUNNY's
temple and blood flows and MUNNY goes to one knee and LITTLE
BILL kicks him hard, whump!
LITTLE BILL
(turning to W.W.)
Mr. Beauchamp, this here is the sort
of trash I was speakin' of.
MUNNY is struggling to his feet and staggering weak-kneed to
the table, where he grabs the whiskey bottle and breaks it
off and turns groggily to face LITTLE BILL.
LITTLE BILL, unperturbed, advances on him and when MUNNY
strikes desperately with the bottle, LITTLE BILL blocks his
blow easily and slams him hard with the muzzle of the pistol
and MUNNY goes down again.
LITTLE BILL
(continuing; to W.W.)
You will find these kind in the
saloons of your prosperous
communities.
Whump, he kicks MUNNY.
LITTLE BILL
(continuing)
But you will not find none of them
in Big Whiskey.
MUNNY is on the floor on all fours, trying gamely to get up.
53 INT. ALICE'S ROOM -- NIGHT 53
NED pushing THE KID out the window of ALICE's room and THE
KID isn't fully dressed and neither is NED, but he pushes
him frantically into the rainy night anyway and ALICE is
urging them on and LITTLE SUE looks ready to wet her pants.
ALICE
(to NED)
Hurry.
(to LITTLE SUE)
You know what to say to Little Bill?
LITTLE SUE nods "yes" but she is speechless with terror and
ALICE hands NED's boots out the window to him.
77.
54 EXT. ALICE'S WINDOW -- NIGHT 54
Outside the window, night, rain, and NED and THE KID trying
to get dressed in the mud and ALICE sticks her head out the
window.
ALICE
You got to look sharp for that old
oak. You miss the oak an' you ain't
gonna find it.
NED
(to THE KID)
Never mind your shirt, get them boots
on.
NED is trying to get his own boots on and he goes down on
his ass in the mud.
ALICE
The roof ain't much but ...
THE KID
What about Bill? What we gonna do
about ...
NED
Come on, Kid. I hope them horses is
still there.
55 INT. BARROOM -- NIGHT 55
MUNNY crawling along the floor of the barroom, covered with
blood, heading for the door.
LITTLE BILL. Let the man out, W.W. He is desiring to leave
the hospitality of Big Whiskey behind him.
MUNNY is crawling past W.W.'S legs and W.W. looks down at
the miserable semi-conscious creature and he sees clearly
the left hand and the three fingers as they fight for traction
and then W.W. steps to the door and opens it and MUNNY crawls
into the rain and the night.
56 INT. ALICE'S ROOM -- NIGHT 56
Slap! ALICE gets LITTLE BILL's big hand across the face.
SKINNY
Easy, Little Bill, she's gotta work,
she's gotta turn a dollar a time.
(CONTINUED)
78.
56 CONTINUED: 56
LITTLE BILL glares at SKINNY. They are in ALICE's room and
CHARLEY is there and LITTLE SUE and W.W. and it is pretty
crowded.
LITTLE BILL
(to ALICE)
If they was just here for the fuckin',
how come they lit out the back window?
ALICE
(defiant)
On account of they seen you was
beatin' on their friend.
LITTLE SUE
(bravely)
Th-th-they just c-c-come for the b-bbilliards, Little Bill, honest.
LITTLE BILL
(snorting)
Billiards!
(to LITTLE SUE)
An' they was just passin' through?
LITTLE SUE
Th-th-they was g-g-goin to F-F-Fort
B-B-Buford t-t-to ...
ALICE
(nasty)
You just kicked the shit out of a
innocent man, you big asshole.
LITTLE BILL
Innocent of what?
57 EXT. SOUTH END OF TOWN -- NIGHT 57
The south end of town, night, rain and the albino mare walking
aimlessly with MUNNY slumped in the saddle and then two riders
come from between two shadowy buildings and it is THE KID
and NED and they come alongside MUNNY, one on each side of
him and NED lifts his slumped head up and looks at the
battered face and winces and says with his eyes what THE KID
says with his tongue.
THE KID
Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus.
79.
58 INT. SHED -- NIGHT 58
Candlelight, NED and THE KID, and NED is sewing MUNNY's face
with a needle and thread.
NED
Hold him, dammit.
It is some sort of straw-filled shed and they have stuck a
candle on a board.
THE KID
(sickened)
Jesus.
(pause)
You done this before?
NED
(working)
Plenty of times.
MUNNY is only semiconscious and THE KID is holding his face
still.
THE KID
His pistol must've jammed.
NED
Move the candle closer, I can't see.
THE KID
He wouldn't've took no beating like
that if it hadn't of jammed. He
wouldn't just give it over an' not
shoot no one.
59 INT. SHED -- DAY 59
Daylight in the shed and MUNNY's face, waxy yellow, crude
stitching, hideous swelling eyes vacant, breathing heavy.
He is lying in the straw and THE KID is looking down at him
with distaste. THE KID is only partly dressed.
THE KID
He don't look so good.
The sound of the rain is different; it's still coming, but
it isn't a storm anymore. The shed is an irregular shelter
because one wall and various parts of the roof have collapsed
and the woods outside are clearly visible.
(CONTINUED)
80.
59 CONTINUED: 59
SILKY is sitting on some straw straightening her clothes and
NED and ALICE are climbing out of a corner where they have
obviously been at it and are in various states of dress.
THE KID
(continuing; to ALICE)
He didn't even pull his pistol, huh?
NED
(irritated)
He ain't as tough as you, Kid.
THE KID
Well, I guess I woulda at least pulled
my pistol an'...
NED
Shit, Kid, you pulled your pistol...
right outta the lady an' out the
back window.
THE KID
That was your idea, I wanted to ...
SILKY
(getting up and
smoothing herself)
We gotta go.
THE KID
Huh? Already? Hey, I'm near ready
for another advance.
SILKY
You're gonna use it all up before
you get it.
ALICE
(about to leave)
No more advances on what you ain't
done yet.
THE KID
Well, we're just waitin' on the
weather. If the weather breaks
tomorrow we could...
NED
(to ALICE)
We're gonna need more food... at
least three days' worth...
(CONTINUED)
81.
59 CONTINUED: (2) 59
THE KID
Three days? We could kill em'
tomorrow.
NED
(a sharp look at THE
KID)
I don't kill nobody without him.
Indicating MUNNY.
THE KID
(frustrated)
We don't need him. The two of us
could do it.
The horses are partly under the roof and ALICE and SILKY are
leading theirs out and nobody is paying attention to THE
KID.
THE KID
(continuing; petulantly)
He ain't nothin' but a broken down
pig farmer.
ALICE
(mounting her horse,
to NED)
One of us'll bring food in the
morning. I guess you'll want some
whiskey.
NED
An' medicine if you got it...
THE KID walks over to the edge of the broken wall and from
the other corner MUNNY moans loudly and then screams.
MUNNY
Ohhhhh, ooohhhh no. No, I didn't do
nothin'.
NED hurries over to MUNNY and THE KID is left there with the
two whores, who are both mounted now and THE KID is
embarrassed.
THE KID
Don't it make you sick, hearin' him
like that?
(as the whores turn
their horses)
Don't you ladies worry none ... Me
and Ned, we'll kill those two fuckers.
(CONTINUED)
82.
59 CONTINUED: (3) 59
And THE KID has picked up two pieces of paper that the whores
gave them earlier and they are charcoal sketches, one of
DAVEY BUNTING and the other of QUICK MIKE and they are pretty
fair likenesses.
60 INT. SHED -- CLOSE ON LANTERN -- NIGHT 60
Hanging from a beam in the shed and it is night again and
the rain has stopped though you can still hear water dripping
from the eaves. Widen.
THE KID
It was a lot of shit what my uncle
told me, huh?
They are playing cards on the straw floor, NED and THE KID
and NED doesn't look up from his cards.
NED
Depends what he told you.
(pause)
About Bill, you mean?
THE KID
All of it. About him, an' you an'
Uncle Pete ... about robbin' the
Rock Island Pacific ... an' about
them Missouri banks.
NED
We done that stuff.
THE KID
Well, I guess Bill Munny wasn't no
fearless killer an' bank robber like
he said.
In the other corner of the room MUNNY gives a loud moan and
both men look at him and then back at their cards.
NED
Kid, it ain't gonna mean nothin' to
you, but the roof I built on my house,
it don't have a leak in it ... not
one.
(as THE KID looks
perplexed)
Most folks think a school-house is
the first sign of civilizin' ... but
I say it's a good roof.
(CONTINUED)
83.
60 CONTINUED: 60
Well, that amazes THE KID, being stuck here with these trainrobber bad men and now this shit about roofs and he just
stares.
MUNNY (O.S.)
Claudia ... No ... Oh, Jesus, Claudia,
ohh ...
NED gets up and takes the lantern over to where MUNNY is
lying and kneels beside him. MUNNY looks ghastly, at death's
door.
NED
Claudia ... ain't here, Bill.
MUNNY
(reaching)
Ned... Is that you, Ned?
(holding NED's arm)
Ned, I seen... death.
NED
Easy, Bill.
MUNNY
I seen the angel of death, Ned, an'
I seen the river.
(panicked)
He's a snake, he got ... snake eyes.
NED
Who, Bill? Who got snake eyes?
MUNNY
The angel ... the angel of death.
I'm scared, Ned. Ned, I'm gonna die.
NED
Easy, Bill, easy.
THE KID has walked over and is watching and it fascinates
and scares him and he watches and swallows hard.
MUNNY
I seen her ... I seen Claudia, too...
NED
(soothing)
Well, that's good now, ain't it,
Bill? Seein' Claudia an'...?
(CONTINUED)
84.
60 CONTINUED: (2) 60
MUNNY
She was all covered with worms. Oh,
Ned, I'm scared of dyin'...
THE KID can't take any more and he turns and walks away and
NED tries to comfort MUNNY and MUNNY grabs him and pulls him
close.
MUNNY
(continuing)
Ned ... don't tell anybody... Don't
tell the kids!... don't tell 'em
none of... none of the things I done.
And NED has tears in his eyes and MUNNY's eyes are staring
and he is seeing something horrible and we...
61 EXT. SHED -- DAY 61
A vision, daylight, and the horse horribly bloody, screaming
silently in agony while the sound is the sound of night and
the shed and the rain dripping, but that doesn't diminish
the agony of the bloody animal as the whip falls on the head
and the eyes and we see the young man cruelly wielding the
whip. It is MUNNY fifteen years younger and it is a picture
of unbelievable cruelty and viciousness... because that is
what he was like and what he remembers.
62 INT. SHED -- NIGHT 62
Night in the shed, a little moonlight coming in through the
open wall. The lantern is out and the sound is the sound of
MUNNY's labored breathing and NED and THE KID are in their
blankets.
THE KID
He's gonna die, ain't he?
NED
Maybe.
THE KID
Well, suppose he does?
NED
(after a pause)
We'll bury him.
THE KID
That ain't what I mean.
(CONTINUED)
85.
62 CONTINUED: 62
NED
You mean, am I gonna help you kill
them cowboys?
THE KID
I can't spot 'em myself, but you
could. That red-haired one, you could
spot a half-mile off, I bet.
NED
An' if I spot 'em?
THE KID
I'll ride up close an' shoot 'em!
NED
Just like that?
THE KID
I told you I'm a damn killer. I done
it before.
Pause, you can hear MUNNY breathing.
THE KID
(continuing)
I'm more killer than him.
NED
Yeah?
THE KID
Hell, yeah.
63 INT. SHED -- DAY 63
Daylight and the cut whore's face. DELILAH is leaning over
MUNNY, wiping his brow. He is lying in the straw looking up
at her and he looks like shit ... his face ghastly pale and
stubbled and covered with horrible cuts and bad stitching...
but his eyes are clear.
MUNNY
I thought ... you was an angel.
DELILAH
(embarrassed, getting
up)
You ain't dead.
DELILAH goes over to her horse and gets some packages out of
the saddle-bags. MUNNY tries to sit up, weakly.
(CONTINUED)
86.
63 CONTINUED: 63
MUNNY
Some big guy beat the shit out of
me.
(feeling his sore
face)
I guess I must look a lot like you,
huh?
DELILAH
(angry, hurt)
You don't look nothin' like me,
mister.
MUNNY
I didn't mean no offense.
She doesn't answer.
MUNNY
(continuing)
I guess you're the one them cowboys
cut up.
No answer.
MUNNY
(continuing)
Ned an' The Kid, my partners, are
they...?
DELILAH
(coldly)
They went out scouting when they saw
your fever broke.
MUNNY
Scouting?
DELILAH
On the Bar T... looking for... them.
MUNNY
Oh. How long I been here?
DELILAH
(still cold)
Three days. Are you hungry?
MUNNY
Three days? I must be.
87.
64 EXT. WOODS NEAR SHED -- CLOSE ON ROBINS -- DAY 64
PULL BACK. Four of them in the woods near the shed and MUNNY
is watching them where he sits wolfing chicken hungrily, his
back against the shed. DELILAH is watching him eat.
MUNNY
I thought I was gone. See them birds?
Most times I wouldn't even notice
them birds much. But I'm noticin'
'em real good 'cause I thought I was
dead.
DELILAH
I brought your hat. You... left it
down at Greely's.
MUNNY
That big guy lookin' for me?
As he looks over at her, MUNNY's eye falls briefly on her
exposed ankle and DELILAH feels the look.
DELILAH
Little Bill? He thinks you went north.
MUNNY can't help it and his eye flicks back to the ankle.
DELILAH
(continuing)
Are you really going to kill them?
MUNNY
(unenthusiastically)
Yeah, I guess.
(suddenly))
There's still a payment, ain't there?
She nods and she moves so that more ankle is showing, but
MUNNY's eye is drawn to her breasts as she moves, then he
looks away quickly, guiltily, and they sit there silently
until...
DELILAH
Them other two, they been takin'
advances on the payment.
MUNNY
Advances?
He can't help looking at her body and she knows it.
(CONTINUED)
88.
64 CONTINUED: 64
DELILAH
(shyly)
Free ones.
Her body is getting to him.
MUNNY
(stupidly)
Free ones?
DELILAH
Alice an' Silky gave them... free
ones.
MUNNY
(understanding,
embarrassed)
Oh. Yeah.
DELILAH
(shy, timid)
You want... a free one?
MUNNY
(looking away,
embarrassed)
Me? No. No, I guess not.
And DELILAH is hurt... crushed. She gets up and covers it by
picking up the remains of the chicken and MUNNY is too
embarrassed to look at her.
DELILAH
(covering her hurt)
I didn't mean... with me. Alice and
Silky, they'll give you one... if
you want.
MUNNY
I... I guess not.
(unusually perceptive
suddenly)
I didn't mean I didn't want one 'cause
of you bein' cut up. I didn't mean
that.
DELILAH keeps her back to him.
(CONTINUED)
89.
64 CONTINUED: (2) 64
MUNNY
(continuing; trying
to get up)
It ain't that at all. You're a
beautiful woman. What I said before,
how I might look like you... I didn't
mean you was ugly, like me, hell
no... I only meant how we both had
scars.
He is standing weakly, supporting himself on the wall and
his speech is so sincere and DELILAH wants to believe it.
MUNNY
(continuing)
You're a beautiful woman an'... if I
was to want a free one, I guess I'd
want you more than them others. It
ain't... See... I can't have no free
one on account of my wife...
DELILAH
Your wife?
MUNNY
Yeah. See?
DELILAH
(after a pause)
I admire that, you being true to
your wife. I've seen a lot of... of
men... who weren't.
MUNNY
(pleased and
embarrassed)
Yeah, I guess.
DELILAH
She back in Kansas?
MUNNY
Uh... yeah. Yeah. She's uh... watchin'
over the little ones.
And MUNNY gives her what for him is his best social smile...
sort of like a pig strangling.
65 EXT. BOX CANYON -- ANGLE ON BAWLING CALF AND RED HOT IRON -- 65
DAY
Coming out of the fire.
(CONTINUED)
90.
65 CONTINUED: 65
It is midday in the box canyon and the four cowboys, TEXAS
SLIM, JOHNNY FOLEY, LIPPY MACGREGOR and DAVEY BUNTING are
branding strays and JOHNNY has the calf down ready for the
pigging string but the calf kicks loose and knocks JOHNNY
into the fire and the other three cowboys are guffawing,
their sweaty faces full of the camaraderie of hardworking
men who might get irritable by the end of the day but not
yet. And then, like a flash, still laughing, young DAVEY is
on his paint and riding like hell after the stray and it is
beautiful to watch because he and the paint are like one.
Crack! A rifle shot and the pony does a violent somersault
and DAVEY goes over in a spray of dirt and fifty yards away,
TEXAS SLIM, LIPPY, and JOHNNY stare frozen in horror.
The downed pony spurts blood from his nostrils, and DAVEY's
right leg is pinned under the dying paint's flank and they
are maybe fifteen yards from the edge of the canyon and
DAVEY's first thought is the pony.
DAVEY
Oh, Jesus, fella...
(shouting)
Boys, my pony's hurt...
And turning, he sees the three cowboys standing fifty yards
away, frozen in their tracks.
DAVEY
(continuing)
Boys...
And they turn suddenly and run away toward some rocks and it
is only then that the terror hits DAVEY and in a sudden panic
he tries to get free of the horse.
DAVEY
(continuing)
Oh, Jesus, boys, my leg's broke. I'm
pinned, boys.
66 EXT. BOULDERS -- ANGLE ON NED -- DAY 66
His face covered with sweat, the Spencer against his cheek,
and he is crouched among some boulders up the canyon wall
about three hundred yards from DAVEY, and MUNNY is looking
over NED's shoulder, and THE KID is trying to see, too,
squinting desperately, but he can't see shit.
MUNNY
Finish him, Ned.
(CONTINUED)
91.
66 CONTINUED: 66
THE KID
He ain't dead? You didn't get him?
MUNNY
(to THE KID, without
turning)
He got the boy's horse.
Looking down the barrel of the rifle, NED can see DAVEY
struggling frantically to get free of the horse, and it is
an easy shot and NED is sweating, his hand is shaking and he
can hear MUNNY's voice.
MUNNY (O.S.)
Better get him 'fore he gets clear
of the horse, Ned.
And NED is shaking and crack, he fires.
67 EXT. BOX CANYON -- ANGLE ON DAVEY -- DAY 67
And dust kicking up a foot away and the extra terror gives
him the strength to pull free of the horse.
JOHNNY (O.S.)
Assassin assholes. You dirty asshole
sonsabitches.
68 EXT. BOULDERS -- DAY 68
MUNNY and NED and THE KID and NED is shaking.
THE KID
Did you kill him?
MUNNY
He's clear of the horse, Ned. Better
get him.
69 EXT. BOX CANYON -- ANGLE ON DAVEY -- DAY 69
And he is crawling clear of the horse, but his leg is broken
and it's hard and he looks toward the rocks where his friends
are hiding sixty yards away.
TEXAS SLIM (O.S.)
(from behind rock)
Behind you, Davey. Go for them rocks
behind you.
And turning, DAVEY can see a couple of boulders only fifteen
yards away that will provide cover.
92.
70 EXT. BOULDERS -- DAY 70
NED aiming and shaking.
THE KID
What happened? He ain't dead? What's
goin' on?
MUNNY
(to NED)
If he gets behind them rocks, we
ain't gonna get him... not without
we go down there.
THE KID
What rocks? Why don't you shoot?
What's goin' on?
JOHNNY (O.S.)
Fuckin' bush-whackin' assholes.
And looking down the barrel, NED can see DAVEY crawling for
the rocks and it is an easy shot and he can't do it and he
looks up at MUNNY and the agony in his eyes says it all.
THE KID
Ain't you gonna shoot? Is he dead?
MUNNY grabs the rifle and NED moves aside and slumps against
a rock and MUNNY looks down the barrel and aims.
MUNNY
I ain't much of a shot.
71 EXT. BOX CANYON -- DAY 71
DAVEY crawling and crack! The dust kicks up eight feet away.
He is ten yards from the boulders and it is agony to crawl.
LIPPY (O.S.)
Keep goin', Davey boy.
Crack! Dust puffs three feet from DAVEY's head.
72 EXT. BOULDERS -- DAY 72
MUNNY, the rifle at his cheek and THE KID leaning frantically
over his shoulder, trying to see.
MUNNY
Shit!
(CONTINUED)
93.
72 CONTINUED: 72
THE KID
What happened, did you hit him?
Bang! Bang! Bang! Pistol shots from below and the bullets
ping harmlessly among the rocks.
THE KID
They're shootin' at us.
JOHNNY (O.S.)
We'll kill you, you assholes.
MUNNY is aiming, he can see DAVEY, nearer shelter now. Crack!
He fires and sees the dust spurt near DAVEY.
LIPPY (O.S.)
You assholes... you stinking ambushing
assholes.
THE KID
Did you get him? Where is he?
73 EXT. BOX CANYON -- DAY 73
DAVEY crawling frantically and crack!... Dust explodes only
inches from his head and he is pulling himself frantically
and he is only three yards from safety.
74 EXT. BOULDERS -- CLOSE ON MUNNY -- DAY 74
And he is sweating.
MUNNY
How many shots I got, Ned?
NED is sitting there dazed, staring vacantly. Bang, Bang,
Bang, return fire pings off the rocks.
MUNNY
(continuing; aiming)
How many left, goddammit?
NED
Two.
And looking down the rifle, MUNNY can see DAVEY's head
disappear behind the boulder and crack, MUNNY fires again.
THE KID
Did you get him?
Bang, Bang, Bang, the pistol fire.
(CONTINUED)
94.
74 CONTINUED: 74
TEXAS SLIM (O.S.)
Keep goin', Davey.
MUNNY is cocking and aiming for his last shot and he can see
DAVEY's legs sticking out from the rock and they're not
moving.
THE KID
Tell me... Christ...
JOHNNY (O.S.)
... Murderin' bastards...
LIPPY (O.S.)
... Fuckin' skunks.
Crack, MUNNY fires.
75 EXT. BOX CANYON -- ANGLE ON DUST PUFFING -- DAY 75
As DAVEY's legs disappear behind the boulder, and there is a
low groan.
76 EXT. BOULDERS -- ANGLE ON MUNNY -- DAY 76
Sitting back against the rock, exhausted, covered with sweat
and he holds the rifle up to THE KID.
MUNNY
Better reload it.
THE KID
You missed him? You didn't...?
MUNNY
I got him.
DAVEY (O.S.)
(scared, hurt).)
Jesus, boys, I'm shot... They shot
me...
TEXAS SLIM (O.S.)
You tramps... you murderin' tramps.
THE KID
(shaken)
He ain't killed.
MUNNY
(washed out)
Maybe, maybe not. Got him in the
gut, I think.
95.
77 EXT. BOX CANYON -- DAY 77
DAVEY lying behind the boulder and the whole front of him is
soaking in bright red blood and the sun is beating down.
DAVEY
Oh, Jesus... I'm hurt... I'm hurt.
They shot me...
78 EXT. BOULDERS -- DAY 78
MUNNY sitting there, his back against the rock, staring
vacantly and NED looks the same.
THE KID
(derisively)
Them assholes can't hit us up here.
Just wastin' bullets.
The cowboys must realize that, because they stop shooting
and you can hear DAVEY moaning, and NED and MUNNY just sit
there and sweat, and THE KID is pacing up and down.
THE KID
(continuing)
You think he's gonna die? You think
we killed him?
NED and MUNNY look into each other's eyes.
DAVEY (O.S.)
(Help me, boys, help me...
MUNNY
(flatly)
Yup... We killed him, I guess.
DAVEY (O.S.)
Oh, Jesus, help me boys, I don't
want to die... I don't want to die.
THE KID
(rattled, shouting)
Shouldn't've cut up no woman, you
asshole.
79 EXT. BOX CANYON -- DAY 79
DAVEY is lying there behind the boulder, drenched in blood,
looking up at the blazing noonday sun.
(CONTINUED)
96.
79 CONTINUED: 79
DAVEY
(shouting)
I'm dyin', boys.
He pauses then, and then he speaks in a normal voice, as
though to himself, to express his amazement, to test reality.
DAVEY
(continuing)
I'm dyin'.
(pause)
I'm dyin'.
(shouting, panicked)
(Boys, I'm dying!)
80 EXT. BOULDERS -- DAY 80
MUNNY sweating and looking up at the sun, and NED staring
vacantly.
DAVEY (O.S.)
I'm thirsty, Slim, Jesus, I'm thirsty.
(pause)
Bring me a drink, won't you, Slim?
One drink, Slim... I'm dyin', Slim...
(pause)
Boys, bring me a drink.
It is getting to all three of them and MUNNY looks up at the
sun and then NED gets up and he walks over to a rock and he
vomits.
DAVEY (O.S.)
One drink... Please, boys... Just
one d...
MUNNY
(leaping up, shouting)
Bring him some goddamn water, you
assholes.
Boulders Nothing happens, you can't tell if the cowboys are
behind there or not.
DAVEY (O.S.)
Please, boys... I'm shot in the gut...
I'm bleedin'... Bring me...
MUNNY
(shouting)
Will you take him a fucking drink
for Christ sake! We ain't gonna shoot.
(CONTINUED)
97.
80 CONTINUED: 80
There is a pause and MUNNY looks down at the boulders where
the cowboys are hiding.
TEXAS SLIM (O.S.)
(from behind the
boulder)
You ain't gonna shoot?
MUNNY
No.
And then, after a long moment, MUNNY sees TEXAS SLIM come
out from behind the boulder and run nervously toward the
rock where DAVEY lies and he is carrying a canteen.
JOHNNY (O.S.)
Don't you shoot him, you assholes.
THE KID is trying to see, but of course he can't.
THE KID
They takin' water?
MUNNY
Yeah.
MUNNY is watching and he sees TEXAS SLIM disappear behind
the boulder where DAVEY is lying and there is a moment of
silence... and then the voice, a scream of grief and
anguish...
TEXAS SLIM (O.S.)
(from behind the
boulder).)
Oh, Jesus, Johnny, they've killed
him... They've shot up his gut...
Oh, Jesus, they've killed young
Davey... Oh, those murderin'
bastards, they've killed our Davey...
And THE KID spits in the dust and NED wipes his forehead
with his bandanna and MUNNY scuffs the dirt with his boot.
81 EXT. HILL -- DAY 81
Hooves on flat rock and the three riders, MUNNY, NED, and
THE KID, are trotting their horses over a smooth slab of
rock near a hill. They are silent, glum, then...
THE KID
When we gonna double back?
(CONTINUED)
98.
81 CONTINUED: 81
MUNNY
After a ways.
NED
(not looking at them)
Not me.
MUNNY looks up sharply, but NED just looks straight ahead.
NED
(continuing)
I'm goin' on down to Kansas.
MUNNY
We got to kill this other one first.
NED doesn't answer.
MUNNY
(continuing)
Shit, Ned, if we're lucky, we could
kill him by nightfall... or maybe
tomorrow morning. Then we could head
back, all three of us, with the money.
NED reins in his horse and MUNNY pulls up, too, and then THE
KID.
NED
(looking him in the
eye)
You want the Spencer, Bill?
He holds out the rifle.
MUNNY
(lamely)
Shit, Ned, this ain't the time to
quit.
THE KID
You're gonna lose your share. If you
don't...
MUNNY
Shut up, Kid.
NED just holds out the rifle and after a moment MUNNY takes
it and NED takes a box of cartridges from his pocket and
hands them over.
NED
I'll see you, Bill. See you, Kid.
(CONTINUED)
99.
81 CONTINUED: (2) 81
And he turns his horse and heads off across open country at
a trot and MUNNY watches him go till he's about fifty yards
away.
MUNNY
(shouting)
Hold on. Ned.
And NED reins up and MUNNY gallops up to him and holds out
the Spencer and the bullets.
MUNNY
I ain't worth a shit with it.
NED takes the rifle, sheathes it, gives a curt nod, and turns
to go.
MUNNY
Me an' The Kid, we'll head over to
the ranch an' as soon as we find
him, we'll shoot him. Then we'll
come back an' the three of us pick
up the money an' head south together.
NED
Supposin' he don't go to the ranch?
MUNNY
I'll bet anything he won't go to
town nor he won't ride out on the
range. Right off he'll hole up at
the ranch.
NED
(turning away)
I ain't waitin', Bill.
(looking back)
I'll look in on your youngsters when
I get back.
MUNNY
(calling after him)
Ned, don't pay no mind to what The
Kid said about the money. I'll bring
your share along, hear? The Kid's
full of shit, hear?
82 EXT. LITTLE BILL'S HOUSE -- ANGLE ON ROOF -- DAY 82
Late afternoon, and LITTLE BILL is crawling around up there
with a bucket of tar which he has got on his moustache and
his face and he looks up because he hears the clatter of
hooves.
(CONTINUED)
100.
82 CONTINUED: 82
ANGLE ON CHARLEY HECKER.
Galloping his horse up to LITTLE BILL's house and CHARLEY is
very excited and he swings off the horse in front of the
porch and the porch is at once closer to completion and closer
to collapse than last we saw it.
CHARLEY
(looking around,
breathless)
Little Bill, Little Bill...
LITTLE BILL (O.S.)
Yeah.
CHARLEY looks up startled and LITTLE BILL is looking down at
him over the eves.
LITTLE BILL
(continuing; sheepish)
Makin' some repairs.
CHARLEY
(breathless)
They killed one of them cowboys.
83 EXT. MAIN STREET -- CLOSE ANGLE ON TORCHLIGHT -- NIGHT 83
Flickering on DAVEY'S waxy face and dead eyes as EGGS, GERMANY
JOE, and PADDY haul the blood-caked body from the back of a
buckboard. Widen. W.W. is looking on queasily, taking notes,
and behind him the street is alive.
WIGGENS (O.S.)
...an' Parsons said how he seen three
men right after sun-up headed out
east an' one was ridin' a old blue
Morgan an' another was on a white
mare, only he didn't...
And only a few yards away from the buckboard, in front of
the County Office, LITTLE BILL is being besieged by deputies
and townsmen.
FATTY
Amos over at the stable says to ask
you if the County's payin' feed for
all the horses or if...
CHARLEY
... Witherspoon says he ain't gonna
sell us no more thirty-thirty shells
without we pay...
(CONTINUED)
101.
83 CONTINUED: 83
And the dogs, snarling, fangs bared, pulling at the leash
and TOM LUCKINBILL is trying to keep control.
TOM
... use the dogs, then the county's
gotta take responsibility for...
LITTLE BILL
(calmly)
Never mind about them horses, Fatty.
Just you ride out to the Bar T an'
make sure that other cowboy stays
put an' don't expose himself, hear?
84 INT. ALICE'S ROOM -- NIGHT 84
ALICE's room and the WHORES. They are sitting glumly in the
dim light of a single lamp. LITTLE SUE is wiping tears away
and DELILAH is staring blankly.
DELILAH
(to no one in
particular)
I didn't think they'd really do it.
ALICE
(nasty)
What did you think, they come clear
up from Kansas to fuck us?
DELILAH
(vacantly)
That Kid... he's just a... boy. And
that other one, Bill, being true to
his wife...
ALICE
What wife? He don't have no wife.
DELILAH
(shocked, hurt)
He said...
ALICE
I told you, he don't have no wife,
not aboveground, anyhow.
DELILAH just eats the pain raw and just then...
Smash! A rock comes through the window and you can hear
someone shouting.
(CONTINUED)
102.
84 CONTINUED: 84
VOICE (O.S.)
You fuckin' murderin' whores.
And they all sit there stunned. And then ALICE recovers and
gets up and goes to the window and hurls the rock back.
ALICE
(shouting)
He had it coming! He had it coming
for what he did...And that other one
too... Both of them... For what they
done.
85 EXT. COUNTY OFFICE -- NIGHT 85
LITTLE BILL and the crowd and the torches outside the County
Office and suddenly there is a commotion and shouting and
everybody turns north and...
FUZZY is riding into town at full gallop, shouting at the
top of his lungs.
FUZZY
We got one. We got one of them
fuckers, we got one...
BYSTANDERS part as FUZZY brings the horse up in front of the
County Office and reins hard and addresses himself
breathlessly to LITTLE BILL.
FUZZY
(continuing)
We got one of them fuckers, Sheriff.
Out by Cow Creek, we...
LITTLE BILL
Alive?
FUZZY
Hell, yeah. A bunch of us Bar T boys

You an' Andy get the hell out there.
Find out where them other two went.
86 EXT. OUTHOUSE -- DAWN 86
Birds chirping cheerily and the outhouse door opens and BUCK
BARTHOL steps out and stretches luxuriously.
ANGLE ON BUSHES
And THE KID holding his nose. The bushes are right behind
the outhouse and the stink is terrible. THE KID is crouched
there and he is doing an elaborate pantomime of his suffering
for MUNNY's benefit.
87 INT. BUNKHOUSE -- ANGLE ON BUCK -- DAY 87
Coming into the bunkhouse. There isn't much light and the
shadowy sleeping figures are more easily discernible by the
snorts and snores they make than by their shapes except for
THIRSTY and QUICK MIKE who are sitting, half-dressed at a
table, rolling cigarettes.
THURSTON
See anythin' out there, Buck?
BUCK
Hell, yes I did.
MIKE looks up nervously.
BUCK
(continuing)
Seen about two hundred fellers packin'
rifles... Fuckers got the place
surrounded, says they want Quick
Mike's ass... I says, "How much?"
They says, "About five." I says,
"Dollars?" They says, "Cents." I
says, "Sold."
MIKE
Well, I ain't worried. I got
protection.
(CONTINUED)
104.
87 CONTINUED: 87
He indicates a nearby bunk. FATTY snoring on the bunk near
QUICK MIKE.
88 EXT. MAIN STREET -- CLOSE ON NED'S FACE -- NIGHT 88
Nose bloodied, eyes blackened, as he rides down the Main
Street of Big Whiskey escorted by six cowboys (including
TEXAS SLIM, JOHNNY FOLEY, and LIPPY MACGREGOR) and CLYDE and
ANDY. NED's wrists are tied and he looks sullen and... scared.
WIDEN. LITTLE BILL and W.W. BEAUCHAMP are standing on the
porch of the Country Office when the little group pulls up
attended by numerous onlookers. LITTLE BILL looks NED over
colly as he addresses CLYDE.
LITTLE BILL
He tell you where them others is?
CLYDE
Nope.
LITTLE BILL
He give 'em names?
CLYDE
Didn't tell us nothin' but his own
name... Ned Roundtree.
LITTLE BILL
Well, Ned, you'll want to tell me
an' Mr. Beauchamp here all about
them two villainous friends of yours,
I guess.
(to CLYDE and ANDY)
Bring him in, boys, for I will be
glad to know the names and the
whereabouts of those other two
murdering sons of bitches.
89 EXT. OUTHOUSE -- ANGLE ON MIDDAY SUN -- DAY 89
Blazing on high and an enormous farting sound...
ANGLE ON OUTHOUSE
After a pause, another vigorous fart and then silence broken
only by the buzzing of flies, and then the sound of newspaper
and suddenly the door opens and THIRSTY steps out and heads
up toward the bunkhouse.
ANGLE ON THE KID.
(CONTINUED)
105.
89 CONTINUED: 89
In the bushes, reacting to the smell and the flies are buzzing
furiously.
THE KID
Sure is fuckin' ripe. I wish we'd
get a breeze.
MUNNY wipes sweat from his face and looks up at the blazing
sun.
MUNNY
It's gonna get riper yet.
THE KID
You still think he's in there?
MUNNY
(his eyes on the
bunkhouse)
Yeah, he's in there.
THE KID
Well, he's holding on to his shit
like it was money.
MUNNY
He's in there.
THE KID
Tell me right off if you see him.
MUNNY
Yup.
THE KID
You... you ain't gonna shoot him
your ownself?
MUNNY
(tired of saying it)
You can shoot him.
THE KID nods, satisfied, but he's keyed up something ferocious
and his fingers play nervously with his pistol.
90 INT. JAIL -- CLOSE ON NED'S FACE -- DAY 90
Jammed against the bars of the cell in the County Office. He
has been tied to the bars outside the cell so that he is,
more or less, spread-eagled in an upright position with his
bare back exposed to LITTLE BILL and CHARLEY HECKER and W.W.
BEAUCHAMP. Widen.
(CONTINUED)
106.
90 CONTINUED: 90
LITTLE BILL
Now then, Ned... You an'... uh...
Mr. Quincy an' uh... What was that
young feller's name?
NED
Tate. Elroy Tate.
W.W. shakes his head at LITTLE BILL and holds out his notebook
for LITTLE BILL to see.
LITTLE BILL
That ain't what you said before,
Ned.
LITTLE BILL empties hot coals from the bowl of his pipe on
NED's shoulder and NED writhes and grits his teeth.
NED
Hell if it ain't.
LITTLE BILL
(looking at W.W.'s
notes)
Before you said Elroy Quincy out of
Medicine Hat an' Henry Tate out of
Cheyenne.
NED
Fuck if I did.
LITTLE BILL
(refilling his pipe)
Charley, go bring them whores here
that fucked these boys the night of
the storm.
CHARLEY
Strawberry Alice an' Silky?
LITTLE BILL
Yeah... an' fetch a bullwhip out of
the German's.
NED's face against the bars in covered with perspiration and
etched with fear as he hears the door close behind CHARLEY.
LITTLE BILL
(continuing; lighting
his pipe)
Now, Ned... them whores are gonna
lie different lies than you... an'
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
107.
90 CONTINUED: (2) 90
LITTLE BILL (CONT'D)
when your lie ain't the same as their
lie... I ain't gonna hurt no woman,
I'm gonna hurt you... not gentle
like I been doin' but... b-a-a-a-ad.
NED swallows hard and sweats and waits.
91 INT. BUNKHOUSE -- CLOSE ON CARDS -- DAY 91
They are playing at the little table in the bunkhouse. Widen.
QUICK MIKE, BUCK, THIRSTY, FATTY ROSSITER and OLAF HARKEN;
and QUICK MIKE doesn't even have a pair and tosses his cards
down in disgust and walks over to his bunk and starts to put
on his boots.
BUCK
(to MIKE)
Where you goin'?
MIKE
Take a shit.
FATTY
(he has two Kings)
Lemmee finish this hand, will you?
MIKE
You gonna protect me while I take a
shit?
QUICK MIKE walks over to a peg and hangs a gunbelt over his
bare shoulder.
BUCK
You could get bushwhacked.
MIKE
(heading for the door)
I'll fart on 'em.
THURSTON
(starting to get up)
I'll go with him.
MIKE
You could wipe my ass, Thirsty.
THURSTON
(sitting down)
Hell with him. Man ain't polite, he
oughta get shot.
108.
92 EXT. OUTHOUSE -- DAY 92
THE KID in the bushes and he hears the door slamming shut up
at the bunkhouse and he squints anxiously.
THE KID
(whispering)
Is it him?
MUNNY
(watching MIKE)
Yup.
THE KID is beside himself, his throat goes dry and he gulps
for air and he brings the hammer back on his pistol and
squints anxiously.
HIS POV
MIKE out of focus approaching from THE KID's POV and gradually
MIKE comes into focus walking closer and we
CUT TO:
THE KID
Sweating, tensed for action and MUNNY looks over at him.
MUNNY
(whispering)
He's yours, Kid. Can you get him?
And THE KID is biting his lip and doesn't answer and QUICK
MIKE is very close and THE KID brings up the pistol and gulps
and doesn't shoot and then it is too late because MIKE has
entered the outhouse. MUNNY is disgusted and he cocks the
shotgun to do it himself.
THE KID is walking on eggshells approaching the door of the
outhouse, pistol in his right hand, and he reaches his left
hand to open the door but he is hesitant and...
MUNNY sees FATTY ROSSITER step casually out of the bunk house
and MUNNY raises the shotgun and FATTY sees THE KID and
screams.
FATTY
Assassins, boys, assassins!
Bawhoom! MUNNY lets go with the shotgun and FATTY dives back
into the bunkhouse and...
THE KID is startled and looks over his shoulder.
(CONTINUED)
109.
92 CONTINUED: 92
MUNNY
Shoot him, Kid!
And THE KID grabs the door with his left hand and opens it
and there is MIKE sitting on the crapper astonished and one
hand is on his holstered pistol but he's frozen and THE KID
is pointing the Schofield at him but THE KID is frozen, too.
MIKE
No! No!
Blam! The Schofield jumps in THE KID's hand and MIKE gets it
in the chest and there is smoke all over and THE KID stares
at MIKE amazed and MIKE, who has a big splotch of blood on
his chest stares back at THE KID amazed also and then...
Blam, THE KID shoots him again, this time in the face. Bang!
Bang! Shots from the bunkhouse and...
Bawhoom! MUNNY blasts the bunkhouse with the shotgun.
MUNNY
Come on, Kid.
Blam, THE KID shoots MIKE's slumping body a third time and
he seems hypnotized but...
Bang, Bang; shots are coming from the bunkhouse and MUNNY is
screaming and THE KID tears himself away.
93 EXT. BUSHES -- DAY 93
MUNNY crashing through the bushes and THE KID is a few yards
behind him and MUNNY stumbles and scrambles to his feet.
MUNNY
Did... you... get... him?
THE KID
(amazed)
Yeah.
94 EXT. OUTHOUSE -- DAY 94
The outhouse and MIKE's body and FATTY and THIRSTY and BUCK
dashing past, waving their guns.
95 EXT. WOODS -- DAY 95
The albino mare and the Morgan in the woods and MUNNY and
THE KID dash up to the horses, gasping for breath, and MUNNY
tries to mount still holding the shotgun and the horse starts
to prance around and MUNNY can't mount.
(CONTINUED)
110.
95 CONTINUED: 95
MUNNY
Hold still.
Bang, Bang, Bang; Shots are whistling around them and looking
back MUNNY can see his pursuers firing from cover fifty yards
away.
MUNNY shoves two shells in the shotgun and hands it to THE
KID who has just mounted.
MUNNY
(continuing)
Cover me, Kid, while I mount.
THE KID
(Panicked).)
I can't see 'em.
Bang, Bang, Bang.
MUNNY
Just shoot!
And Ka Blamm, THE KID lets go both barrels in the general
direction of the enemy and then MUNNY gallops away half-on
his horse, half-off, in an undignified escape, bullets
whistling around his horse and THE KID behind him shouting.
THE KID
Where are you, Bill? where are you?
I can't see you! Wait for me.
And then they disappear and gradually the shooting stops.
96 EXT. OPEN COUNTRY -- DUSK 96
Open country at sundown seen from a low hill, and you can
barely make out a lone rider approaching in the extreme
distance.
ANGLE ON MUNNY
Standing on the rise and watching the rider in the distance.
THE KID
Is that what it was like, Bill, in
the old days... ridin' out with
everybody shootin'... smoke all over
an' folks yellin' an' bullets whizzin'
by?
THE KID is behind BILL sitting under a large oak drinking
from a whiskey bottle.
(CONTINUED)
111.
96 CONTINUED: 96
MUNNY
(absently)
Yeah, I guess so.
THE KID
Shit... I thought they was gonna get
us. I was even... scared a little...
just for a minute.
(pause)
Was you ever scared in them days?
MUNNY turns from watching the RIDER's slow approach and walks
over to THE KID who can't see the RIDER from where he's
sitting.
MUNNY
I don't remember, Kid. I was drunk
most of the time. Give me a pull on
that bottle, will you?
MUNNY takes a big pull on the bottle, returns it to THE KID,
and walks back to the edge of the rise to resume his vigil.
The RIDER is a little closer now and the sun is a little
lower. It is very beautiful.
THE KID
(drinking heavy)
I shot that fucker three times. He
was takin' a shit. He went for his
pistol an' I blazed away... first
shot got him in the chest...
THE KID wipes whiskey from his chin. He has been working
hard to make the hysteria he feels into a high... but it
won't quite come.
THE KID
(continuing)
... Say, Bill...
MUNNY
Yeah.
MUNNY is watching the RIDER and the RIDER is closer.
THE KID
That was... the first one.
MUNNY
First one what?
(CONTINUED)
112.
96 CONTINUED: (2) 96
THE KID
First one I ever killed.
MUNNY
(preoccupied with his
vigil)
Yeah?
THE KID
How I said I shot five men... it
wasn't true.
(long pause)
That Mexican... the one that come at
me with a knife... I busted his leg
with a shovel... I didn't shoot him
or nothin'.
MUNNY is watching the rider and the rider is much closer,
but coming at a walk and MUNNY goes back over to THE KID for
a pull on the bottle and he's trying to make THE KID feel
okay when he says...
MUNNY
Well, that fella today, you shot him
all right.
THE KID
(forced bravado)
H-hell, yeah. I killed the hell out
of him... three shots... he was takin'
a sh-sh-shit an'... an'...
THE KID is shaking, becoming hysterical, he can't go on, and
MUNNY hands the bottle back.
MUNNY
Take a drink, Kid.
THE KID
(breaking down, crying)
Oh Ch-Ch-Christ... it don't... it
don't seem... real... How he's...
dead... how he ain't gonna breathe
no more... n-n-never. Or the other
one neither... On account of... of
just... pullin' a trigger.
MUNNY walks back to the edge of the rise and watches the
RIDER and it is a lovely sunset happening and he is talking
to no one in particular.
(CONTINUED)
113.
96 CONTINUED: (3) 96
MUNNY
It's a hell of a thing, ain't it,
killin' a man. You take everythin'
he's got... an' everythin' he's ever
gonna have...
THE KID
(trying to pull himself
together)
Well, I gu-guess they had it...
comin'.
MUNNY
We all got it comin', Kid.
ANGLE ON RIDER
At the foot of the rise and it is LITTLE SUE and...
ANGLE ON MUNNY
Pulling the saddlebags off and LITTLE SUE is still mounted.
They are under the oak tree and it is dusk and THE KID is
just sitting there with his bottle.
MUNNY
I was watchin' you... seein' if you
was followed.
LITTLE SUE
(scared to death)
Silky an' Faith, they rode off to
the east an' two deputies was
followin' them.
MUNNY has lit a little candle and spread a blanket and he is
opening the bags to count the money.
MUNNY
(pouring out the coins
and bills)
You wanna help me count, Kid?
THE KID is leaning against the tree in a semi-stupor.
THE KID
I trust you, Bill.
MUNNY
Well, you don't wanna trust me too
much. We'll take Ned his share
together so you don't figure I run
off with it.
(CONTINUED)
114.
96 CONTINUED: (4) 96
LITTLE SUE
(startled)
Ned's share?
MUNNY
(counting)
Yeah, he went south ahead of us. I
guess we'll catch him before...
LITTLE SUE
(blurting it out)
He's... He's dead.
MUNNY
(counting)
No he ain't. He went south yesterday.
LITTLE SUE
They... they killed him. I... thought
you knew that. I thought you knew
because...
MUNNY
(looking up)
Nobody didn't kill Ned, he went south
yesterday. He didn't even kill nobody.
Why would anybody kill Ned?
LITTLE SUE just looks back at him, scared, trembling.
MUNNY
(continuing; realizing)
Who killed him?
LITTLE SUE
Little Bill. The... the Bar T boys
caught him and Little Bill...
MUNNY
He hanged him?
(as LITTLE SUE shakes
her head no)
Shot him down?
LITTLE SUE
N-no. He!... he beat him up. He was
making him... answer questions...
and beating him up... and then...
Ned just died.
(pause)
Little Bill didn't mean to kill him...
he said he was sorry an' all... but
he said it was a good example anyhow.
(CONTINUED)
115.
96 CONTINUED: (5) 96
MUNNY
(outraged).)
Good example! Good example of what,
I'd like to know? He didn't even
kill nobody... he couldn't do it no
more.
LITTLE SUE
They got... a sign on him says he
was a killer.
MUNNY
(flabbergasted)
A sign on him?
LITTLE SUE
In front of Greely's. It says, "This
here is what happens to..."
MUNNY
(incredulous)
They got a sign on him in front of
Greely's?
THE KID just has his head in his hands, it's too much for
him and LITTLE SUE is scared shitless of MUNNY.
MUNNY
(continuing)
The questions Little Bill asked him...
what sort of questions was they?
LITTLE SUE
About where you an' him...
(indicating THE KID)
... was... an' where you was from...
an' what your names was... an'...
MUNNY
What'd Ned say?
LITTLE SUE
L-lies... at first. About how you
was just passin' through and didn't
kill nobody... an' Little Bill kept
askin' questions, mixin' him up,
catchin' lies... an' then he'd beat
on Ned an' Ned would cry and lie
some more an' then... then...
MUNNY
Then... what?
(CONTINUED)
116.
96 CONTINUED: (6) 96
LITTLE SUE
A cowboy come in sayin' you killed
Quick Mike in the shit house at the
Bar T...
MUNNY
An' Little Bill killed Ned for what
I done?
LITTLE SUE
Not on purpose. But he started hurtin'
him worse... makin' him tell stuff.
First Ned wouldn't say nothin'...
but Little Bill hurt him so bad he
said who you was...
MUNNY looks up sharply. LITTLE SUE is scared, her voice
quavers...
LITTLE SUE
(continuing)
... He said how you was really Three
Fingered Jack out of Missouri... an'
Bill said "Same Three Fingered Jack
that dynamited the Rock Island and
Pacific in '69 killin' women and
children an' all?" An' Ned says you
done a lot worse than that, said you
was more cold-blooded than William
Bonney or Clay Alisson or the James
Brothers an' how if he hurt Ned again
you was gonna come an' kill him like
you killed a U.S. Marshal in '73.
MUNNY
Didn't scare Little Bill though, did
it?
LITTLE SUE
N-no, sir.
MUNNY
Lemme see that Schofield, Kid.
THE KID
Wha... what f-for?
MUNNY
(sharply)
Lemmee see it.
(CONTINUED)
117.
96 CONTINUED: (7) 96
THE KID
(giving it to him)
Sure. Sure, Bill.
MUNNY takes the pistol and begins to check it methodically,
inspecting the load first... and THE KID watches nervously,
shifting from foot to foot.
THE KID
(continuing)
You... you could keep it, Bill. I
ain't... gonna use it no more, I
ain't gonna kill nobody.
MUNNY, still checking the gun, glances up and meets THE KID's
uneasy gaze.
THE KID
(continuing)
I... I ain't like you, Bill.
MUNNY looks back at the pistol, checks the sights.
THE KID
(continuing)
You... gonna take... the money?
MUNNY
(to LITTLE SUE)
You better get on back, miss.
And LITTLE SUE, still mounted, breathes an enormous silent
sigh of relief and turns her horse away hastily and MUNNY,
satisfied with the pistol, sticks it in his belt and walks
over to his horse and pulls his sawed-off shotgun out of the
bedroll.
THE KID
You could have it. All of it.
MUNNY
(checking the shotgun)
I thought you wanted to buy spectacles
an' fancy clothes an' all.
THE KID
I'd rather be blind and ragged than
dead, I guess.
MUNNY looks at THE KID who is behaving bravely but is
trembling anyway, scared, and MUNNY's eyes are full of
brutally painful memories.
(CONTINUED)
118.
96 CONTINUED: (8) 96
MUNNY
Shit, Kid. I ain't gonna kill you.
You're... the only friend I got.
97 EXT. NORTH ROAD -- NIGHT 97
Moonlight on the ordinance #14 sign on the North Road and
two riders come up slow, MUNNY and THE KID, and MUNNY reins
up and then THE KID does, too. MUNNY takes the saddlebags
off his horse.
MUNNY
(giving THE KID the
bags)
This here money, take my share an'
Ned's an' leave it with my youngsters.
Tell 'em half goes to Sally Two Trees
if I ain't back in a week. The rest
is yours... you could buy them
spectacles.
THE KID
Are you... Are you gonna... kill
Little Bill?
MUNNY
(holding up the whiskey
bottle)
I guess you won't mind my keepin'
the bottle.
THE KID
You're gonna kill him, ain't you?
MUNNY
Stay clear of folks you might see.
There's plenty out lookin' to hang
you. Go on now, skedaddle.
MUNNY slaps THE KID's horse and THE KID sets out at a trot
and MUNNY watches him disappear into the night. When he is
alone and he can't hear THE KID's horse anymore, MUNNY uncorks
the bottle and takes a long deep drink.
98 EXT. GREELY'S PORCH -- ANGLE ON NED'S BODY -- NIGHT 98
In the upright coffin in the flickering light of a torch
standing next to it and, of course, NED looks bad and the
crudely scrawled sign over the coffin says, "This is what
happens to assassins around here."
119.
99 INT. BARROOM -- ANGLE ON LITTLE BILL -- NIGHT 99
In the crowded bar and he is shouting to make himself heard
over the din.
LITTLE BILL
All right, I'm gonna say just one
more time so it's all clear an' then
don't ask me no more.
The place is packed with tired, dusty men and they are not
really jubilant so much as they are excited by the hysteria
of events.
LITTLE BILL
(continuing)
Now each of you that posse'd today
has got one drink comin' off the
county budget...
THURSTON
Yahoo.
LITTLE BILL
... An' whoever rode yesterday, gets
one drink for that...
PADDY
Yippee.
EGGS
I told yuh two, I...
LITTLE BILL
Hold it, hold it. After them two,
it's outta your own pocket... Hear
me, Skinny?... An' we're pullin' out
early tomorrow an' chase these fellas
clear to Texas so I wouldn't spend
much of your own money.
There is a general whoop and hubbub as LITTLE BILL turns
back to his conversation at the bar with CHARLEY, FATTY,
CLYDE, ANDY and W.W. BEAUCHAMP.
LITTLE BILL
(continuing)
Now if we divide up into four parties
an' hit all the farms an' trails in
a circle, we're bound to find some
one who seen them skunks an'...
(CONTINUED)
120.
99 CONTINUED: 99
LITTLE BILL is suddenly conscious of his own loud voice in a
sudden silence that has swept the bar like a brushfire and,
turning, he sees what everybody is staring at.
MUNNY, with his 10-gauge shotgun leveled from the shoulder,
is standing thirty feet away in the doorway. Taking a couple
of sideways steps to get the door behind his back and sweeping
the twin barrels in an ominous arc, he surveys the scene.
MUNNY
(a little drunk)
Which fucker owns this shithole?
Nobody says a thing. SKINNY stares pop-eyed from behind the
bar and the sweat starts on his forehead and LITTLE BILL is
thinking coolly and everybody else is swallowing hard and
looking at the shotgun.
MUNNY
(continuing; to FATTY)
You there, fat man, speak up.
FATTY gulps and then SKINNY screws up his courage and steps
from behind the bar and gives it every bit of dignity his
fear will permit.
SKINNY
I... I own this establishment. I
bought it from Greely for a thous...
MUNNY
(to the men round
SKINNY)
Better step clear, boys.
And SKINNY looks from side to side as people step away from
him and he wants to say something desperately, he wants to
live, he wants...
LITTLE BILL
Hold on, mist...
Bah-whoom! MUNNY fires and smoke belches and...
SKINNY is blown back against the wall and he falls to the
floor a bloody mess and...
LITTLE BILL is reaching for the Spencer which is leaning
against the bar near his leg but he freezes because...
MUNNY has turned the shotgun on him and MUNNY sees NED's
Spencer there and his eyes show how he feels about it.
(CONTINUED)
121.
99 CONTINUED: (2) 99
For a moment, while the smoke clears, the bar is silent, and
there are nervous glances cast at the bloody body of SKINNY,
but LITTLE BILL keeps his eyes on MUNNY.
LITTLE BILL
(continuing)
Well, sir You are a cowardly son of
a bitch, because you have just shot
down an unarmed man.
It has become a very formal moment and there are, figuratively
speaking, only two people in the room, MUNNY and LITTLE
BILL... and W.W. BEAUCHAMP is watching them, scared to death,
but this is it, what all those Easterners dreamed about, the
showdown in the saloon.
MUNNY
(the shotgun pointed
right at LITTLE BILL)
He should have armed himself if he
was gonna decorate his saloon with
the body of my friend.
LITTLE BILL
I guess you are Three-Fingered Jack
out of Missouri, killer of women and
children.
MUNNY
(a little drunkenly)
I have done that... killed women and
children... I have killed most
everything that walks or crawls an'
now I have come to kill you, Little
Bill, for what you done to Ned.
(to the others)
Now step aside, boys.
And as the DEPUTIES nervously move aside, LITTLE BILL helps
to isolate himself by stepping forward boldly.
LITTLE BILL
He's got one barrel left, gentlemen.
After he has used it, pull your
pistols and shoot him down like the
cowardly, drunken scoundrel he is.
LITTLE BILL looks back at MUNNY bravely and...
MUNNY looks down the barrel at LITTLE BILL and after a tense
moment he pulls the trigger.
(CONTINUED)
122.
99 CONTINUED: (3) 99
Click. The hammer falls, but it is a misfire and what happens
next happens in maybe five seconds as all hell breaks loose.
LITTLE BILL
(drawing)
Misfire! Kill the son of a bitch!
And LITTLE BILL aims carefully and... MUNNY hurls the shotgun
at him and...
Blam!... LITTLE BILL fires wildly as the shotgun hits him
and...
CLYDE has his pistol out and is pointing it at MUNNY and...
MUNNY is pulling his pistol from his own belt and he drops
to one knee and...
Blam!... CLYDE fires and misses and... LITTLE BILL is about
to squeeze the trigger when...
Blam!... MUNNY shoots him and...
Blam!... LITTLE BILL shoots just as he is hit in the chest
and...
Blam! Blam!... FATTY fires wildly and...
MUNNY is aiming, too, and Blam!...
CLYDE gets it in the face and...
Blam!... Blam!... FATTY isn't even aiming while...
ANDY aims carefully, he can kill MUNNY but...
MUNNY turns and points his weapon at ANDY and...
Instead of firing, ANDY panics and tries to turn his body
sideways to ward off the blow and...
Blam!... MUNNY fires and...
ANDY gets it high in the ribcage and...
CHARLEY turns and runs for the back and...
Blam! Blam!... FATTY is backing up and firing from the hip
and then he turns to run and...
MUNNY aims deliberately from one knee and Blam!...
FATTY goes down, shot in the back...
(CONTINUED)
123.
99 CONTINUED: (4) 99
And suddenly... there is a terrible silence that is broken
only by the awful, dying groans of CLYDE and the coughing of
the BYSTANDERS hiding behind tables and chairs in the thick
black smoke and...
MUNNY is still down on one knee, pointing his pistol and
looking through the thick smoke for someone to shoot, but it
seems there are no threats left.
MUNNY
Every asshole that doesn't want to
get shot, best clear out the back
quick.
And they scramble over each other, dashing toward the billiard
room, and MUNNY stands up and looks around and he looks at
CLYDE who is groaning, his face covered with blood, and
everybody else, LITTLE BILL, ANDY, and FATTY are still, and
then FATTY seems to move and MUNNY levels his pistol and
what happens is W.W. crawls out from half-under FATTY and
W.W. is covered with blood and he is shaking like a leaf.
W.W.
I... I... think I'm... shot.
MUNNY
You ain't shot.
W.W.
(seeing the pistol)
P-p-p-please, I'm not armed.
As MUNNY lowers the pistol, W.W. looks around.
W.W.
(continuing)
M-m-my G-god. You killed Little Bill.
MUNNY
(cuspicious)
You sure you ain't armed?
W.W.
I never c-c-carry arms. I'm... a
writer.
MUNNY
A writer? What do you write... letters
an' such?
W.W.
B-b-books.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
124.
99 CONTINUED: (5) 99
W.W. (CONT'D)
(amazed)
You... you killed five men... singlehanded.
MUNNY
(wearily)
Yeah.
MUNNY walks over to the bar, keeping his eye suspiciously on
W.W., and reaches for a bottle with his left hand. The hand
is shaking like palsy and he tilts the bottle and drinks
sloppily with effort, the pistol still in his right hand.
W.W.
Wh-wh-who did you kill first?
MUNNY
Huh?
W.W.
(reciting)
Wh-wh-when confronted by superior
numbers, the experienced gunfighter
will fire on the best shots first.
MUNNY
(drinking).)
Yeah?
Unnoticed on the floor, LITTLE BILL is conscious, though
blood is coming out of his mouth and he has been written
off. One hand is shifting on his pistol and he can hear CLYDE
moaning sporadically.
W.W.
Little Bill told me that. You killed
him first, didn't you?
On the floor, Little Bill is fighting for consciousness,
fingering his pistol.
MUNNY
I was lucky in the order.
(bitterly)
I always been lucky killin' folks.
W.W.
(absorbed)
Who was next? Clyde? Or was it...?
(CONTINUED)
125.
99 CONTINUED: (6) 99
MUNNY
(suddenly ominous,
pistol pointing)
I could tell you who was last, mister.
W.W.'s eyes pop as he gets the idea and he backs up fast,
and then he turns and bolts out the back, and watching him
go, MUNNY turns his back on the fallen body of LITTLE BILL.
LITTLE BILL, on the floor, raises up his pistol in his shaking
hand and aims at MUNNY's back, maybe six feet away, and he
is shaking bad as he draws the hammer back and...
MUNNY hears the click and he turns and sees LITTLE BILL
aiming, but it is too late and...
Blam! Smoke and fire from LITTLE BILL's pistol and LITTLE
BILL's arm collapses from the effort and the pistol falls
with a bang.
MUNNY
(continuing)
Missed again, asshole.
And MUNNY steps over to him and kicks the pistol away from
LITTLE BILL's outstretched hand. LITTLE BILL is bleeding
from the mouth, having taken a shot in the lung, and he is
very weak and all he can do is look up at MUNNY and speak
weakly.
LITTLE BILL
I don't... deserve this... to die
this way. I was... building a house.
MUNNY
(aiming his pistol
point blank)
"Deserve" don't mean shit, Little
Bill.
LITTLE BILL
(the pistol in his
face)
I'll see you... in hell, you threefingered asshole.
Blam! MUNNY shoots LITTLE BILL and then he looks around and
CLYDE is still groaning and that is the only sound. Then,
suddenly, he is all business. He walks quickly over to CLYDE
and shoots him once with the Spencer and the groaning stops.
Then he goes over to LITTLE BILL's body and pokes around in
the pockets and pulls out some shells for the Spencer. He
shoves those in his pocket and he goes to the bar and picks

up the bottle of whiskey and walks over to the door. Standing
to one side, he kicks it open. Then he sets down the rifle
and the bottle and starts to reload the Schofield and while
he loads it, he shouts out the door.
MUNNY
I'm comin' outta here... an' any
fucker I see out there, I'm gonna
kill him... an' any fucker takes a
shot at me, I ain't just gonna kill
him, but I'm gonna kill his wife an'
all his friends an' burn his fucking
house, hear?
The pistol is loaded and MUNNY sticks it in his belt and he
takes a long pull on the whiskey bottle and wipes the dribble
from his chin. Then, he picks up the rifle in the other hand
and looks out the door.
100 EXT. MAIN STREET/GREELY'S -- NIGHT 100
The street, and it is dark and quiet, shadowy buildings, the
knot of tethered horses, a couple of torches stuck in the
ground, sputtering.
MUNNY (O.S.)
Nobody better shoot on account of
I'm as mean as I say... maybe meaner.
I am a damn badman an' you will not
find a worse one in hell.
And MUNNY steps out of the door warily, and looks around and
all he sees are the shadowy buildings and all he hears are
his own boots on the wooden porch. Glancing nervously at the
dark buildings' blank stares he walks past the upright coffin
where the waxy face of NED stares gruesomely in the light of
the flickering torch and he gives it a glance, wanting to
say he's sorry, but the idea is ludicrous and he steps off
the porch and walks toward the white mare.
101 EXT. ALLEYWAY -- NIGHT 101
W.W. BEAUCHAMP and CHARLEY HECKER and GERMANY JOE crouched
in the alleyway between two buildings across the street and
CHARLEY has a rifle and they can see MUNNY mounting his horse.
GERMANY JOE
(whispering)
Go ahead, shoot him.
CHARLEY just shakes his head and offers the rifle to GERMANY
JOE. And GERMANY JOE doesn't want it.
(CONTINUED)
127.
101 CONTINUED: 101
GERMANY JOE
(continuing)
I endt no dehpoody.
W.W. is watching MUNNY's unbelievably awkward and prolonged
mounting procedure and he can't believe it, he can't believe
what the Old West is like and it shows on his face.
102 EXT. MAIN STREET -- NIGHT 102
MUNNY riding down the dark, lonely street at a trot and he
starts to shout at the top of his lungs:
MUNNY
You boys better bury old NED right...
and you better not carve up nor
otherwise harm no whores... or I
will come back an' kill more
sonsabitches, hear?
And there are tears running down MUNNY's cheeks.
103 EXT. SOD HUT -- DAY 103
Daylight and PENNY sweeping in the doorway of MUNNY's sod
hut in Kansas. She is intent on her work until she hears the
snort of a horse and looks up and her jaw drops, and her
face lights up like the sun itself and, dropping the broom,
she dashes toward him.
ANGLE ON MUNNY
MUNNY walking across the field, leading the mare. He is
covered with dust and heavily stubbled from the trip. PENNY
dashes up to him and throws her arms around him and he is
overjoyed, but he doesn't have any way to express it except
through awkwardness and embarrassment.
MUNNY
(fondly)
Ain't you a lady!
And he puts his arm around her and they walk toward the house.
104 EXT. HOG PENS -- ANGLE ON WILL -- DAY 104
Working in the hog pens in back, concentrating on the job.
MUNNY
Place looks good.
And WILL whirls around and sees MUNNY standing there beside
the house and his first instinct is to run to him and then

he remembers his dignity and stands there like a man, but
the grin is liable to break his face.
WILL
Hullo, Paw.
MUNNY
I guess you lost some hogs to the
fever.
WILL
Three.
MUNNY
Three? That ain't bad considerin'.
WILL is pissing in his pants with pride and pleasure and he
joins his father and they walk around the house together.
WILL
That fella come by... Tom.
MUNNY
(stopping)
Tom?
WILL
The one you rode out after... the
one that had the pistol...
MUNNY
The Kid, yeah...
WILL
Only he wasn't carryin' no pistol
this time.
105 INT. SHED -- DAY 105
WILL and MUNNY in the shed and WILL is digging deep into a
huge pile of straw.
MUNNY
(worried)
He say anythin'... The Kid...?
WILL
(digging)
Tom? Only how... how if you didn't...
didn't come back in a week...
(upset)
... how he was to take half the money
to Sally an' say you was...
(CONTINUED)
129.
105 CONTINUED: 105
MUNNY
(gently).)
Well, I come back, didn't I?
And WILL has exposed the saddle-bags and MUNNY moves in and
opens them and gold coins and wads of bills spill out.
WILL
(upset)
Did you... did you...?
MUNNY
(counting)
Did I what?
WILL
All that money... I mean... did
you...?
MUNNY
(counting)
Steal it? Naw, I didn't steal it.
WILL
No... I meant...
MUNNY
(turning)
What?
WILL
K-k-kill somebody?
MUNNY
Who said that?
WILL
N-nobody... only you took your shotgun
an' that pistol an'...
MUNNY
(bothered, putting
his arm around WILL's
shoulders)
Before I met your maw, God rest her
soul, it used to be I was kinda...
wicked... drinkin' spirits an' gettin'
into scrapes an' all. Only she made
me see the error of my ways an'... I
ain't like I was no more.
(CONTINUED)
130.
105 CONTINUED: (2) 105
WILL
(relieved)
I guess you didn't kill nobody then.
MUNNY
(it is an effort)
Naw, son, I didn't kill nobody.
106 EXT. GRAVE -- DAY 106
The grave of Claudia under the trees and MUNNY walks up to
it and maybe we hear music or maybe just the wind, but the
words begin to crawl across screen, supered:
"They were married in St. Louis in 1870 and they traveled
north to Kansas where he engaged in farming and swine
husbandry. She bore him two children in the eight years of
their marriage and when she died, it was not at his hands as
her mother might have expected, but of smallpox."
ANGLE ON MUNNY
We are looking at him by now and there is nothing easy on
his face, no big emotions, he is just looking at the grave.
Written words crawl across screen:
"Some years later, Mrs. Ansonia Feathers made the arduous
journey to Hodgeman County to visit the last resting place
of her only daughter".
ANGLE ON GRAVE
We are looking at the stone now and the words continue:
"William Munny had long since sold the place and disappeared
with the children... some said to San Francisco where it was
rumored he prospered as a dry goods merchant under a different
name".
CLOSE ON Eyes of WILLIAM MUNNY The eyes of the husband and
the pig farmer and the man who shot down five men in the Big
Whiskey saloon. Written words:
"And there was nothing on the stone to explain to Mrs.
Feathers why her only daughter had married a known thief and
murderer, a man of notoriously vicious and intemperate
disposition".
FADE OUT:
THE END
