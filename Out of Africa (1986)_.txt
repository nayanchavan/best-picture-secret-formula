EXT/THE AFRICAN PLAIN-DAY-CLOSE ON A RIVERINE THICKET

NO MUSIC. The thicket is sundappled and still, too green
for Africa. The SIBILANCE of the AIR, of RUNNING WATER,
unseen. CHITTERINGS and STIRRINGS. Suddenly, the FLURRY of
a chase: a SHARP SCREAM, small, cut short. A HUSH.

And now, the VOICE of an OLD WOMAN .. dry . . precise.

HER VOICE
I had a farm in Africa, at the foot
of the Ngong hills.

Slowly, SHOT WIDENS. BEGIN MAIN. TITLES.

HER VOICE (eent'd)

The equator runs across these
highlands, a hundred miles to the
north, and the farm lay at an
altitude of over six theusand feet.
In the daytime, you felt that you had
got high up, near to the sun, but the
early mernings and evenings were
limpid and restful, and the nights
were cold.

The thicket is merely an cutpost of bush and tree, clinging
at che river's edge, beseiged by a broad, ¢rassy plain.
INTO VIEW: a licness, muzzle dark with blood, and new, her
black-maned mate. They stare INTO CAMERA . . dominate is
+ « RECEDE as SEOT WIDENS.

EER VOICE (cont'd)

The geographical position and the
height of the land combined te create
a landscape that had not its like in
all the world. There was no fat on
it, and no luxuriance anywhere; it
was Africa distilled up through six
thousand feet, like the streng and
refined essence of a continent.

INTO VIEW: Cape buffalo, hostile . . curious giraffe,
stock-still . . Thomson's and Grant's gazelles, taut es
springs: all are fixed on THE CAMERA, the lions now lest to
sight. SHOT (BALLOCN-MOUNTED) BECOMES AERIAL, CONTINUES TO
WIDEN. TITLES CONTINUE.

HER VOICE (cont'd)

The colors were dry and burnt, like
the colors in pottery. Upen the grass
of the great plains the crooked bare
old thorn-trees were scattered, and
the grass was spiced like thyme and
beg-myrtle; in some places the scent
was so strong that it smarted in the
nostrils.

{ CONTINUED )
2/
CONTINUED:

The plain is a-great yellow-green lawn, cropped close by a
thousand grazing animals. There are zebra, impala, topi,
wildebeest. INTO FRAME at great distance: an open safari
car, its noise unheard, raffling the game in its pfath.
Indistinet, the figures of two men, and with them, a woman.

HER VOICE (cont'd)
The views were immensely wide.
Everything that you saw made for
greatness and freedom and unequalled
nobility. .

The SHOT is vast and still IT WIDENS.

HER VOICE (cont'd)
In the middle of the day, the air was
alive over the land like a flame
burning; it scintillated, waved and
shone like running water, mirrored
and doubled all objects, and created
great Fata Morgana.

The CAR, diminished, LEAVES THE SHOT. Again the plain is

tranquil, man's passing an irrelevance. The SHOT is now a -

panorama, all the world contained by the horizon. Above,
towering up, cumulonimbus advance. END TITLES.

HER VOICE (cont'd)
Up in this high air, you breathed
easily, drawing in a vital assurance
and lightness of heart. In the
highlands, you woke up in the morning
and thought:

Here I am, where I ought. to be.

SHOT HOLDS: a scene from prehistory, God's mind before the
thought of Adam.

INT/EXT/A BALCONIED BEDROOM AT MOMBASA CLUB=DAY

CLOSE ON KAREN DINESEN in profile, glistening, slick with
sweat. She drinks champagne, languidiy strokes her face and
neck, tastes her salt. Idle:

KAREN
When is it they marry us?

She is 28, aristocratic, rebellicus, sardonic: a romantic
protecting her heart by acting the realist. Her intellect
is substantial, of little value to a woman of her time, her
emotions those of a gifted child, unloved. Her masks fail
so hide her vulnerability: about her always, a sense cf
yearning that is beth appetite and hunger.
3/
HER POV=-FROM THE BALCONY

To establish Mombasa: a ribbon of surf, Fort Jesus looming

over the dhows in the harbor.

BROR (0.S.)
Tomerrow morning. Before the train.
Do you plan to be there?

ANOTHER ANGLE

Her damp kimono gapes and clings. In a chair beside her,
cheerfully naked, BROR BLIXEN, 26, typically at ease, her
deerhound at his feet. Born to the Swedish purple, he is
without guile or guilt, an innecent hedonist unburdened by
complexities: there will always be something to ride after.

Their manner is peculiar: fond, familiar, yet detached.

. KAREN *:
It's that or home to mother: I'll be
there. Unless you find me .. dull.

BROR
In bed? Hardly. We surely frightened
the dog. I've been wanting to do that
with you for quite some time.

KAREN
Traly?.

. BROR
Since I was ten, as I remember. You
were my Older Woman. By the time I
knew how all the parts worked, you'd
taken up with Hans.

KAREN
I den't believe I know him.

BROR
He did care about you, Tanne.
KAREN
Never.
BROR

You were trying to own him. None of
us wants that.

KAREN
Can't we send to the wharf to see
about my crates? That's all omy
erystal. All my Limoges.

(CONTINUED )
4/
CONTINUED:

“'BROR
it's broken or it's not.

(beat)
- is it strange, having been with twins?

KAREN
(cool)
It lacks variety, yes.

She steps into the room, locks for a cigarette. Above the
rumpled bed, mosquito netting tied in a ball. Bror and the
Gog follow. He'll pour wine, sit on a stool.

- ROR
(a grin)
Sorry.

. KAREN
Tell me about the farn.

BROR
You must wait: it's a surprise. -

RAREN
. Tell me something, then. What are
the women like? And don't say you
don't know.

BROR
Just women. Less stuffy than at home.
They shoot well, some of them.

KAREN
Better than I do?

BROR
Not birds. It will take a bit fer you
to learn the game.

KAREN
2 won't nag, but I don't want you
involved in anything serious.

BROR
You're sche one that's prone to that.

RAREN
No more. If 2 fail in leve with
‘anyone, I'll want it to be yor.
(beat)
I've taiked you inte this, haven't I?

BROR
You did say I'd be a fool to say no.
Or was it idiot?

- (CONTINUED )
4A/
CONTINUED:

KAREN
There are other women with money.

BROR
None I like as well.

He takes a sponge from a bowl on the bureau, wets his head.
Then, casual:

BROR (cont'd)
Hans says you want my title.

Her laughter, rieh with candor, then, sericus: -

KAREN
You've never judged me, have you?

BROR
Often. You want much more than anyone
can havee-you may pay for that. But
I like you for it. There's neo point
in living small.

KAREN
No. ‘

Be slips her gewn to her waist, sponges her neck end
shoulders. She shudders at tue water's trickle. And with
pleasure.
. KAREN (cont'd)
I feel like an cotter. Slippery.

BROR
(a grin) .
And behave like one.

He begins to sponge her breast. Her eyes close: she guides
his hand. :
5/
EXT/DENSE GREEN FOREST-DAY

Dawn, a light mist rising. From a stand of bamboo, the
HEAVY PROGRESS and BELLY RUMBLINGS of a great animal meving
slowly, feeding. A swatch of gray hide, a flash of ivery.

DENYS FINCE-EATTON .
In bush shorts with suspenders, an old dress shirt without
a collar, a felt terai. He is intent, net concerned, all
possibilities agreed to.

He is Eton and Oxford, the sen of an earl, his family's
motto Je Respondray (I will answer); about him, a detached
delight, a reserve, amused, which holds him at a distance:
he accepts all things as they are, is pleased by the
absurd, But he fears an obligation (a limit te his freedom)
the way some men fear a snake.

His rifle is a°Rigby double, unadorned. In the webbing of
the small fingers of his left hand, twe cartridges: he may
fire twice, reload, shoot twice more--in eight seconds. He
finds it fair that one day, eight seconds may not be
enough. ;

FIND KANUTEIA cff his right shoulder, small and wild,
perpetually silent, without questions because the idea of
alternatives does not occur. Perhaps he is a primitive: his
father died not knowing that iron had become steel, that
. there were oceans, and white men wis believed the land
could be possessed.

There is a clarity to their relationship: In the face of a
charge, Denys will shoot until the animal is down or they
are overrun; if Denys leaps aside, or if Kanuthia has fled
when he turns for his second rifle, the man who ran may
live. They are not friends: only honer is involved. They
have stood together many times.

DENYS'S POV
Twenty yards to the left, WASILI, an old tracker; wiry,

with a staff, looks to Denys, shakes a pouch: a fine dust
drifts on the wind--away from the elephant.
6/
WIDER

Denys is very close to the tusker, closer than we knew, Sut
the animal is in heavy cover, moving away, and he must have
a head shot. Denys makes @ SOUND, a lew THRUMM in his
throat. The elephant stops still. A SILENCE.

Their movements careful, Denys and Kanuthia circle left.
Suddenly, with a GREAT SQUEAL, the elephant CRASHES AWAY
through the forest, no shot available. .

They convene, the natives locking to Denys for judgment. He
gives his rifle to Kanuthia, THRUMMS, self-deriding. Wasili
HOOTS; Kanuthia permits a small smile; Denys shrugs. They
move off after the elephant.

INT/AN OPFICE-DAY :

High-ceilinged, spartan, adobe. Karen in traveling clothes,
Bror in a white suit, stand before an OFFICER in khaki who
has help with the names from a small sheet of paper.

OFFICER

On the authority of His Majesty's
government residing in me, I de
declare that Karen Christentze
Dinesen. a female subject of the
kingdom of Denmark, and the honorable
Bror von Slixen-Finecke, baron to ti
king cf Sweden, are today and
henceforth united as man and wife.
God save this company. Ged save the
King.

We'll have your papers straightaway.

He leaves the room. As Bror turns away, Karen takes his
sleeve, eyes full.

KAREN
Thank you for this.

BROR
Baroness 3lixen.

EXT/THE OPEN PLAIN-DAY-VERY WIDE

The drylands, shimmering in the heat, barely relieved by
whistling thorn, waitea-bit. In the middleground, rhino,
and small on the horizon, a moving train: two freight cars,
two flat cars, three coaches. Looming beyond: Kilimanjaro.

ON A PLAT CAR
Half-loaded with crates of all sizes. Three men and a BOY,

16, Americans, bang away at the game, AD LIBS gibes and
curses; they'll shoot at anything, at any distance.
T/
ANOTHER ANGLE

Leaning on a crate, sipping warm beer, judgmental, HERKELEY
(Barclay) COLE, 26, in appearance a bey, small and fair,
nearly delicate, his gaze a man's. A WHOOP: zebra near the
track. A fusillade. .

ONE ZEBRA

A fountain of bleed spurts, two red blotches spread along
its rib cage. Five steps and it falters to its knees,
RECEDES as the train. moves on, left as carrion.

THRE FLAT CAR
The boy turns away, pleased, offers his rifle.

THE BOY
Would you like to have a try?

BERKELEY
Thank you, no.

.EXT/THE PLAIN-DAY

Denys and Wasili on their haunches, intent, grinning at
their game of small stones, ANGLE ADJUSTING TO REVEAL their
meager equipment,- the elephant's bloody-stumped tusks,
Kanuthia, staring down the train track.

INT/FIRST CLASS COACH=-DAY

Facing wooden benches the length of the car. SBror, THREE
OTHER MEN sit, stand, drink from flasks, tin cups, pass
among them Karen's wedding gift: a bolt-action rifle,
beautifully machined, stock inlaid. ,

Brass-beund gun case open on her lap, Karen sits opposite

LORD DELAMERE, 43, a stocky Churchill, imperious, hair
rling to the shoulder, in each hand a cartridge, one a

massive .600 solid-nese, the-other a sleek .375 magnum.

DELAMERE
There's a  bloedy big beast . just
there! Ee thinks: shall I mash her?!
He comes! Pick your gun!

EXT/THE TRAIN

The whites pile out, the blacks in the last two cars
eraning to see. Denys and the Europeans AD LIB greetings,
gather at the ivory. In the b.g., Berkeley strolls from the
flat car, the Americans following. Karen's dog dashes
about. ,

No, I really musn't.

You'd rather kill for sport?

Kikuyu in Eurepean castoffs held horses, mind carriages. aA

A HUGE MAN extricates himself, moves ponderously to the
iawn party.

ON TEE LAWN-MOVING

Buffet tables, punch bowls, pink gins on silver trays,
silent servants. Children Tun, two boys fight hard,
ignored. A variety of dress: khaki, kilts, caftans, summer
dresses, every sort of hat and helmet on both sexes. Fly
whisks on some wrists, women with revolvers on their hips,
a drink in every hand.

About the settlers threughout, in costume and setting,
always the coincidence of luxury and deprivation: battered
boots beneath a Paris gown, fine wine in a tin cup,
elegance at odds with some shabby detail. ‘

INT/DENYS'S STUDY-DAY-CLOSE ON FARAH

Turbaned, stiff on a camel saddle stool; inscrutable,
waiting. He is Somali, that race Hamitic: Pharaoh's son in
blackface. ©0.5., the MUTED NOISE of the PARTY. He stands.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Because Karen, lying on a couch, a cool eletkh on her
forehead, is stirring, sits up, slow to wake.

. FARAH .
Msabu. I am Parah Aden. We can go
now.

And abruptly departs. Karen looks about.

A great number of books, native art, a huge elephant tusk,
a half dozen hats, memorabilia of public school days, a
littered desk, some sheet music, a dehydrated orange, a gun
cabinet with a dozen rifles and shotguns. As she moves to
the deor, she pauses a moment to look at photographs of two
women, leaves the roon.

_ EXT/APPROACHING THE FARM~NIGET

Two ox-wagons loaded with her baggage move penderously in
the night, native drivers silent, Farah on one wagon box,
Karen dozing on the other, Bror on horseback.

As they turn up the drive to the house, a substantial stone
bungalow, the grounds wild about it. From bomas off-screen,
the Kikuyu begin. to gather, the children running, Laughiag,
falling silent when they're near.

Bello the house!

And Karen wakes.

AT THE HOUSE

A few lanterns and a white tan, BELKNAP, pushing through
the crowd. As he helps her down, Bror SPEAKS sharply in
Swahili: from the throng, a ragged "JAMBO, MEMSAAB.*

BROR .
This is Belknap, Karen: he runs the -
farm, Farah the house.

BELKNAP
Good evening, ma'am:

KAREN
You're American, then.

BELKNAP
Yes, ma'am.

KAREN

You've got experience with a dairy,
Mister Belknap?

BELKNAP

No, ma‘am.

And this is Esa: not a bad cook as
they go out here.

Old and grizzied, Esa bows; Karen SAYS just: "Esa."

BROR

And this one's Juma. Houseboy, but
he'll do whatever.

Juma, young and anxious, in a fez, manages a gentle "“JAMBO,
MEMSAAB"; her “EELLO, JOMA” is warm.

BROR
And here's your house.

HOLD ON KAREN, looking not at the house but gravely into
the faces of the Kikuytz around her, some of them children.

INT/THE LIVING ROOM-NIGHT

Two kerosene lamps, and two more held by Bror and Farah,
she shadows strong, but there is a fireplace, and the sense
shat it is clean and solid, but nearly empty, furnished
just with Bror's necessities. An antipathy between Farah

He's sound enough.

For my lover's brother.

Brer looks at her, very cold, wipes his mouth.

Be grabs her hair clese to her head, yanks her to her feet.

at him with the candle, wax dripping. He knocks it away,
SWEARING, batting at his pants. A furious look between
them, dominance at issue.

Slow, he comes for her--but she might spring at him! In a
flash, he has her, kisses her brutally--and she kisses him

They break, gleaming with sexual combat, utterly equal. He
grabs at the waistband of her shorts; she strikes >.2 in
the face with her fist. A moment. They're apart; he might
kill her now--and she is not afraid. Contemptucusly slow,
she takes off her shorts, throws them away.

She pushes past him to the door, pulling off her shirt,
Brer following, past Juma, returning with decanted wine.
Undismissed, Juma rights her glass, is pouring when, 0.S.,
a dull THUD, a beat, and her small YELP, hurt and passion
indistinguishable.

Juma doesn't spill a drop.
EXT/THE HOUSE-DAY
Kikuyu children play, Farah directs the unleading of the

Wagons. Karen comes onte the terrace, sipping tea. Work

A flicker of fear. She sips her tea.

Kikuyu with. scythes are levelling the tall grass. KXaren's
gestures are wide: it's a large lawn that's wanted. Farah
is patient. :

EXT/A CREEK BED-DAY .

There's a narrow stream, but the converging wash is dry.
For reasons unfathomable cco Farah, Karen wants the main
Stream dammed te divert the flow up the wash te pond; he

Her deerhound's hostilisty has given way to euriosity, but
Parah is implacable.

She gets into bed to read, pulls Bror's pillow beside her,
studies his side of the bed, empty, picks up her book.

INT/DRAWING ROOM-DAY

Fully furnished now, open to the terrace. A small BOY, very
solemn, waits just inside the ‘door, gazes at a cuckoo

First light, misty and still. Karen rides away from the

EXT/THE WILD COUNTRY-A SERIES OF SHOTS

To show the game as she rides, suggesting the Eden which
Kenya then was. Today, the abundance is gone but the
variety remains: fifteen minutes from the Nairobi airport
is a reserve inhabited by lion, cheetah, rhino, elephant,
giraffe, eland, waterbuck, hippo, Warthog, wildebeest,
baboon, kengeni, zebra, impala, bushbuck, c¢tecodile,
ostrich, Themson's and Grant's gazelles.

To be included: the sense of a killing ground=-tern earth
dark with bleed, scattered bone, the remains of a
carcass-~a feeling of Africa, not Bambi.

And Karen, not communing with nature but tense, alert.
EXT/A HILLSIDE-DAY

Karen sits elbows to knees, scanning the plain below with
binoculars. Her herse, ground-tied, browses a Gistance

“away, her rifle in its scabbard. The horse WHICKERS; she

ignores: it.

A lioness thirty yards away, coming through the grass,
stealthy.

The herse WHINNIES, bolts a few yards, turns to look.
She looks to the horse, thes opposite.
The lioness, closer, stock-still, staring at her. .

She's terrified, frozen: any second she will try to run.
Now, an absolute order, flat, dead calm:

net shoot her.
He is behind her, rifle casually ready, Kanuthia at hand.

adult, unafraid. Spontaneously, she stops to CALL after

when the regular army's got here,
we'll attach to them as intelligence.

youngest child, dragged by the hand, turns back to PIPE:
“Agante, memsaab."

Riding up, Felicity, a gutted gazelle across her pommel.
The coltish assurance of a year ago has given way to a
fragile bravado betrayed by awkwardness: she is both ehild

She walks with her MOTHER, a somber women all in black,
stolid, not elegant. .

He is so excited that he must run away.

Kamante has thought long and hard about this momen: of
Grama, has put on old bandages; now, with great affect, he
slowly unwraps them.tco reveal his leg, s¢arred but well.
Karen is appropriately grave but her eyes are merry.

You are well enough to work then.

T am ccoking now for Esa. He is not
bap-ti-sed so now he is dead.

KAREN
Are you paid wages for this cooking?

Net so much as Esa.

down at the owl, strokes it, looks up again.

The Kikuyu can restrain themselves no longer: their
LAUGHTER explodes. They leap, bend double, same fall on the

Most people kissing. Felicity's kissing Denys for all she's
worth. A woman has thrown herself at Barclay. Without a
partner, Karen looks for Brer: he's newhere to be seen. Her

eyes meet Denys's. He speaks to Felicity, kisses her on the
forehead, moves toward Karen. She sees him, turns away.

WITH EER

Her escape route blocked by revelers, their backs to her.
Turning, she bumps smack into Denys, spills her glass. A
moment between them: we can feel her fright. He's gentle,
serious:

DENYS
Once a year's all right, I think.

And kisses her. She's stiff, doesn't respond at ail.

The other kissing's over so the group around them notices,
AD LIBS jeers, jibes at Denys. She's bleak.

DENYS (cont'd)
I've embarrassed you. I'm sorry.

So she kisses him, a magnificent kiss, her body beld. She
means only to defy their audience--small CHEERS, some women
watch shrewdly--but when they break, both are somber. She

Denys whispers instructions, points, sends her ahead. He's
behind on her right, Kanuthia on his right, Wasili Staying
put. .

Karen's intent, checks her safety again and again. Like the
prospect of being hanged, lions concentrate the mind.

The big male sees then, stops feeding.

She looks back to Denys. He nods. It's about forty yards.
She's raising her rifle when, 0.5., a SNARL, a very ugly

sound. .

FLASH CUT

Karen, quizzical, half-turning to Denys. FREEZE IT.

On her left, a huge male explodes from the grass, chasces
home. We SEE *wo bounds.

SLOW MOTION

Denys turns, brings up his-:rifle: Karen's Squarely in his
line of fire. °

VERY SLOW MOTION

Karen turns, smeoth, the rifle easing into her shoulder;
we SEE it kick once, then again. And only now, BEAR the
CRACK of her rifle. And AGAIN.

SLOW MOTION

The licn stumbles, tumbles down in the grass.

The big male on the zebra charges: graat leaps.

SLOW MOTION

Denys pivots, FIRES once, the SOUND delayed.

Cordite smoke hangs in che air. Karen turns to Denys,
terror on her face. He's intent.

SUDDENLY, REAL TIME

PENYS
Lead! Now!

She fumbles with her rifle, reloads. Denys watches both
lions, back and forth. The other lions withdraw.

Kanuthia moves forward, throwing stones at Karen's lion. In
time, he stands near it. It's dead.

Denys walks carefully to his lion, dead, too.

Rifle at her waist, she hasn't moved. Denys goes to her.
She is standing tall, refusing to collapse; her lip
trembles; she bites it to keep from crying.

DENYS
(slow, calm, very firm)
When we are hunting, it's essential
that you do exaczly as I say. I must

Go to your lion now.

A MOMENT LATER

She walks around her lion, brushes at her tears. Kanuthia
takes her rifle, clicks the safety on.

LATER

She sits cfoss-legged, studies the lion's massive head,
touches an eyetooth, feels the point. She examines a
forepaw--she needs beth hands for this--feels the claws,
the dewelaw, puts the paw to her face, rubs her cheek
against it, bleeds from a single long scratch.

Denys and Kanuthia come, bloody from skinning the other
lion.

DENYS
We'll take his hide now.

You'll have to tell me how.

Start along his hind leg.

She goes to the lion, starts to cut.

He takes off her shirt. She holds her arms over her head;
he removes her camisole. He touches her breast,- unbuttons
her shorts; they slide to her feet. He slips her panties
down her legs; she kicks them away.

TWO SHOT-TIGHT

A hungry, urgent kiss. As he moves to her neck and

Relaxed, waiting. Stiff, Karen shifts. Now, slow, he

Very near, a snake. It slithers along, full of menace.

Two lions (their eyes, Mostly), caught by the light. two

EXT/POLO PIELD-DAY

Reli-for-leather, no uniforms oz helmets, settlers versus
Government House. Cars, carriages, spectators line the
field; two inebriates cross it, eblivious to their peril.
Much drinking, SHOUTING.

The action's furious: riders fall, careen through the
crowd, the referee FIRES a pistol when the ball goes out of
bounds. Bror's a contestant, but the action belongs to
Felicity, 20, very much a woman, one of two on the field.
She's expert, reckless, striking. ‘

Karen watches, chats with Lady Macmillan. She is older. at
the eyes, perhaps a bit of gray, but not for the worse:

LADY MACMILLAN

SIR JOSEPH
Please do me the courtesy of letting
us discuss this in a proper way.

Delamere. and Denys are fighting off grins.

KAREN ;
You musn't be embarrassed. I've lost
everything--it costs me very little,
to beg of you.

The Commissioner is motioning for an officious aide. Sir
Joseph's wife, LADY BYRNE, regal, watches Xaren sharply.

KAREN (cont'd) |
The land was theirs, you see: we took
it. And now they've nowhere to go.

The aide arrives, would lift her to her feet, but:
DENYS
(pleasant) -
I shouldn't do that.
DELAMERE
(more pleasant)
Por fear you'd break an arm.

Sir Joseph, no fool, assesses things: the settlers are
perfectly capable of slugging it out.

SIR JOSEPE

the very best we. can.

RAREN
May I have your word, Sir Joseph?

LADY BYRNE
You have mine, madam.

Karen gets up, brushes her skirt, SAYS thank you to Sir
Joseph, pauses before Lady Byrne.

I do thank you.
And curtsies low. The movement of the line resumes.

Karen, Delamere and Denys, drinking. -

DELAMERE

Laughter. Now Denys, exaggerating great sad eyes:

DENYS
“You musn't be embarrassed. Just
because F've wrecked your party."

RAREN
They've gone soft, I tell you. Old
Belfield would have left me there ‘
till midnight.

DELAMERE
You do know what you said: Africa for
the Africans? We'll not hear the last
of that.

: KAREN —
That's a justice we'll never see.

You're getting old, tee: for a moment
there, I thought you were going to
help me.

move the larger pieces outside. Farah follows her.

INT/DINING ROOM=-NIGHT

The room is nearly bare, much as it was when she first
came. The candlebra is gone: stubby candles dight the
table. They've dressed for dinner; her gown is long but she
wears no jewelry and no makeup. Juma pours coffee, would
retire, but:

KAREN
Juma? Take off those silly gloves.

A broad smile. He removes them, leaves them on the table.
She smokes, looks around at the room.

RAREN
We should have had it this way all
the time.

When you're through with this rummage
sale of yours, let's do something
just ourselves?

KAREN
I want te go flying.

DENYS
Um. I'm going down to Tsavo--there's
some land might be right for a
tourist place. I'll come get you
Friday. We'll go te Rudolph for the
weekend: there's a spot I know.

DENYS

All right. :
She stands, holds out her hand to him.

KAREN
Come dance with me then.
EXT/THE TERRACE-NIGET

Denys brings the gramophone to the old stone mill table.
They wind it, start the record: a WALTZ, made fer an
eighteenth century ballroom. She takes off her shoes.

We're CLOSE ON THEM as they dance. A sense of their pain,
their acceptance of it, and of great love. In time, tears |
on his cheeks. Not hers.

Mummy was wrong.

They wave, he goes toward his truck. Karen CALLS toe him.
Underhand, she throws the orange--a long way, really, but
still it bounces, rolls toward him. He retrieves it, waves
ancther goodbye.

But she's already engaged with a shopper.

hanging back. .
DENYS
Kwenda sasa,
Kanuthia doesn't move. Denys is thoughtful: he doesn't

dismiss the Africans in these things. He walks round the
plane, checks rudders and ailerons, guy wires. Nothing.

He gets into the cockpit, motions to Kanuthia to heave on
the prop. The ENGINE COMES ALIVE.

Denys looks to Kanuthia, shrugs. Kanuthia hesitates, then,

giving another meaning to the gesture, shrugs himself, gets
into the forward seat.

The last of the rummage sale, most items gone. Karen's
taking money from a shopper, locks to the terrace.

Farah, hands behind his back, staring at the sky. Now he
looks to Karen, sees her watching, turns away, guilty.

She knows.

INT/DRAWING ROOM-DAY

Sundown. She is sitting stiffly act her desk, hands crossed,
waiting. The SOUND OF A CAR (0.S.) and at the front door,

The minister steps back, looks to Karen. She removes her

‘hat and veil, runs her fingers through her hair. Por the

first time we see her face: it's gaunt, beautiful. ser
voice will be low, steady, clear:

KAREN .
The time you won your town the race/
We chaired you through the marketplace/
Man and bey stood Cheering by/
And home we brought you, shoulder-high.

Today, the road all Tunners come/
Shoulder-high we bring you home/
And set you at your threshold down/
Townaman . . of a stiller town,

PAN the mourners. Brave men swallow. Women are crying.
Tears flow furiously from Bror's eyes; he will not wipe
them. Delamere is trembling.

KAREN (0.S.) (cont'd)
Smart lad, to slip betimes away/ -
Prom fields where glory does not stay/
Early though the laurel grows/
It withers quicker than a rose.

Pelicity buries her face on her father's shoulder. Lady
Macmillan's chin is very high. Lady Byrne turns away to
stare up the hill.

And Wasili, alone at distance, watches.

Now you will note swell the rout/

Of lads that wore their honors out/
Runners whem renown outran/
And the name died fore the man.

Not a tear. She no longer needs the book.

So set, before its echoes fade/
The fleet foot on the sill of shade/
And hold to the low lintel up/
The still-defended challenge cup.

And round that early-lacreled head/

Will flock to gaze the Strengthless dead/

And find unwithered on its curls/

A garland . . briefer than a girl's.

Moment. Her voice steadies. She looks up at the hills.

KAREN (cont'd)
Now take back the soul of Denys
George Pinch-Hatton, whom you have
shared with us. He brought us joy, we
loved him well. He was Ret ours.

He was not mine.

She bends to take a handful of earth to drop into the
grave. Her lips move: we cannot mal-a it out. She may have
Said:' I love you. ‘ ,

But she cannct drop the earth; the gesture is too final. rt
trickles away through her hand. She turns to the mourners,
looks at them all . . and Seems to shrug. She walks away,
not toward the cars but down the slope cf the hill.

At distance, Parah waits.

She pauses once, to take off her shoes. Far~off, she passes
by Farah, who turns te follow her down the hill.

EXT/THE FARM~DAY
She says good-bye to Kamante and Juma at the house, walks
with Parah to her car, loaded with not much luggage, the
deg following. Spread over the. lawn, hundreds of silent
Kikuyu. .

not be away from Africa. Will you
wear it, until I fetch it from you?

FARAH
Yes , msabu.

She would like to touch his face, shakes his hand instead.
She gets inte the car, drives away, does not look back. As
she goes, from the Kikuyu, a ragged KWAHERI, forlorn. |
