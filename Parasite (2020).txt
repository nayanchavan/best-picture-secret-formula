TITLE SEQUENCE OVER BLACK 
Accompanied by dark but curiously upbeat MUSIC. 
At the end of the credits, the MAIN TITLE, in strange 
calligraphy, fills the screen -- 
“PARASITE”
MUSIC FADES. 
INT. SEMI-BASEMENT - DAY 
A dank semi-basement apartment. KI-WOO, 24, runs from corner 
to corner searching desperately for a Wi-Fi signal. Various 
networks pop up, but they’re all password-protected. 
KI-WOO
NO. Not you too “iptime.” 
Ki-Jung! Upstairs neighbor 
finally locked up his Wi-Fi. 
ADJACENT ROOM --
Lying on the floor of the narrow room, KI-JUNG, 23, barely 
moves her lips -- ‘Fuck.’
KI-JUNG
Try ‘123456789.’ Then try it 
backwards. 
KI-WOO 
No luck. 
ANOTHER ROOM --
Also lying on the floor, CHUNG-SOOK, 49, the mother, scoffs at 
their collective misery. 
CHUNG-SOOK
What am I supposed to do if 
someone calls me? What if it’s a 
job? Hey, Ki-Tek! 
She kicks KI-TEK, 49, who is sleeping at her feet.
CHUNG-SOOK (CONT’D)
I know you’re awake, asshole. 
Care to comment?
KI-TEK
(wiping his drool)
What?  CHUNG-SOOK
Our phones have been suspended for 
weeks, and now the neighbors have 
shut us out. What’s your plan? 
She kicks him again.
CHUNG-SOOK (CONT’D)
What are you going to do about it? 
What’s the plan, genius?
She treats Ki-Tek like shit, but it doesn’t bother him. He 
rises with the most serene, enlightened smile, then plods over 
to the -- 
LIVING ROOM SLASH KITCHEN 
Where he removes a bag of white bread from the sad, empty 
fridge. The bread is nearly gone too. Only the ends remain. 
Ki-Tek takes a piece and picks off the moldy parts. He chews 
on the bread as he watches his son’s Wi-Fi dance.
KI-TEK
Son, if one seeks Wi-Fi-- 
He raises his hand high.
KI-TEK (CONT’D)
One must reach into the heavens. 
Up. 
KI-WOO
Yes, Father. 
Ki-Woo raises the phone high as he heads into the --
BATHROOM
The bathroom is long and narrow and has a raised ‘altar’ at the 
far end where the toilet sits. The odd placement is 
necessitated by the semi-basement’s lower position in relation 
to the septic tank. 
Ki-Woo walks in and climbs onto the toilet seat. He continues 
to fish for a signal when -- 
KI-WOO (CONT’D)
BOOYAH! 
KI-JUNG (O.S.)
You got it? 
Ki-Jung barges in and walks over with her phone held up. 
2. 3 3
KI-WOO
You see it? “coffeenara_2G”. I 
guess it’s a new coffee joint. 
Must be nearby. 
KI-JUNG
I’m not getting shit. 
KI-WOO
Get up closer. 
Ki-Jung climbs onto the altar and squeezes next to Ki-Woo. The 
siblings look ridiculous. Head touching the ceiling. Huddled 
on top of the toilet seat. 
Chung-Sook pops in. 
CHUNG-SOOK
No text from Pizza Time? 2,000 
more boxes and it’s payday. 
INT. SEMI-BASEMENT - LATER 
The family sits among piles of UNASSEMBLED PIZZA BOXES and 
folds them in silence. The crunch of cardboard is the only 
sound as the cheap Pizza Time logo comes in and goes out of the 
foreground. 
They hear a truck rattling closer. Through the window, they 
see a STREET FUMIGATION TRUCK spewing gas as it passes by. The 
fog rolls closer to the window. 
KI-JUNG
(to Ki-Woo)
Close the window.
KI-TEK
Leave it. Free fumigation. Get 
rid of the damn crickets. 
Ki-Woo, who was about to close the window, sits back down. 
The FOG quickly envelops the family as they continue to fold. 
It’s rather poignant. A family braving through tear-inducing 
fumes just to make a meager living. 
CHUNG-SOOK
(gasps)
Shit!
KI-JUNG
(coughing)
I told you to close it!
CHUNG-SOOK
Fuck me. 
3. 4 4
Ki-Tek continues folding despite his red, bulging face. He 
desperately holds back his cough. 
Ki-Woo goes to the bathroom and returns moments later with his 
phone. He shows the family a GIF he downloaded. 
KI-WOO
Watch. If we all fold like this 
girl, we might even get paid 
today.
The GIF shows “The World’s Fastest Pizza Box Folder,” a WHITE 
GIRL with dazzling box-folding skills. She’s fast. 
The family watches in awe. Inspired by the clip, they start 
folding with renewed vigor. 
Ki-Tek also picks up speed, but he lacks the dexterity of the 
others. He’s getting more and more sloppy. 
INT/EXT. SEMI-BASEMENT - ENTRANCE - LATE AFTERNOON 
Through the half-open door, we see the female PIZZA SHOP OWNER 
standing outside the entrance. Quirky appearance. Pizza Time 
T-shirt. 
PIZZA SHOP OWNER
Look at this for example. This 
shitty folding job here. 
The Owner shows Chung-Sook a botched corner. 
PIZZA SHOP OWNER (CONT’D)
One out of four. One-fourth of 
the boxes are unusable. 
One out of four? The family all look at Ki-Tek. 
He just smiles. Innocent as ever. 
CHUNG-SOOK
(sighs)
Still, you can’t cut ten percent 
from my pay. That’s too much. 
LATER -- 
Ki-Woo helps a MAN load boxes into a van. 
Ki-Tek looks out from the apartment window, watching Chung-Sook 
squabble with the Pizza Shop Owner. 
PIZZA SHOP OWNER
I should pay even less considering 
the number of botched boxes. 
4. CHUNG-SOOK
We were barely making anything to 
begin with. 
PIZZA SHOP OWNER
Look. It’s not that simple. Each 
ruined box exponentially tarnishes 
our brand’s image. 
CHUNG-SOOK
Your “brand”? You only have two 
stores in Seoul. Fuck this-- 
PIZZA SHOP OWNER
What did you say?
Ki-Woo quickly steps in, diffusing the situation with an easy 
smile. 
KI-WOO
It’s that kid, isn’t it? 
PIZZA SHOP OWNER
What are you talking about?
KI-WOO
The part-timer at your shop. He 
went MIA, didn’t he? During such 
a crucial time too. You have a 
large group order from The Love of 
Christ Church. That’s why you and 
your husband are out here working 
your bottoms off. 
PIZZA SHOP OWNER
How do you know that? Who told 
you?
KI-WOO
That kid, he’s my friend. 
KI-JUNG
Totally unreliable. Not-sostellar reputation.
KI-WOO
I understand you’re upset. Ten 
percent? Fine, we accept. That’s 
completely within your authority. 
However--
PIZZA SHOP OWNER
However what? 
KI-WOO
Would you consider hiring a new 
employee? 
5. 5 5
KI-JUNG
Fire the loser who bailed on you.
The Owner just stares at the smiling siblings. What the hell 
are these people?
KI-WOO
I can come in for an interview 
tomorrow. What would be a good 
time for you? 
PIZZA SHOP OWNER
Wait. Hold on. I need to think 
about this-- 
The Owner senses a trap and tries to get out of it. She takes 
out a few bills from her fanny pack and starts counting one by 
one. 
The family all stare. It’s been a while since they’ve seen 
money. 
INT. SEMI-BASEMENT - EARLY EVENING 
The ‘master bedroom’ next to the entrance. Wall adorned with 
pictures of a young Chung-Sook competing at a national track 
and field championship as a student athlete. A SHOT PUTTER. 
Great upper body glimpsed through tight uniform. No pictures 
of Ki-Tek. 
Early evening. It’s darker. The four family members are 
gathered around a table filled with various store-bought foods. 
KI-TEK
What a special occasion. The four 
of us gathered here to celebrate 
the partial reactivation of our 
phones as well as our son’s 
upcoming job interview with a 
national franchise. 
Ki-Tek tries to deliver a heartfelt speech like a TV patriarch 
but severely lacks the gravitas. Chung-Sook and Ki-Jung are 
already drinking their beers. 
KI-WOO
Cheers!
KI-TEK
To family! 
(re: window)
That son of a bitch. It’s not 
even dark yet!
6. The family turns to see -- 
A DRUNK MAN teetering toward the semi-basement window. 
Their faces slowly fill with dread. 
CHUNG-SOOK
How many times did I tell you? We 
need to put up a “No Urinating” 
sign. 
KI-TEK
It’ll make them want to do it even 
more. It’s psychology. 
KI-JUNG
(to Ki-Woo)
Go yell at him or something! 
KI-WOO
It’s not the right timing--
The Drunk Man hasn’t unzipped his pants, still hovering 
uncertainly in the dark corner. 
KI-WOO (CONT’D)
(hesitates)
I need to catch him in the act. 
CHUNG-SOOK
Isn’t it fucking obvious? Just 
kick him out!
KI-JUNG
(to herself)
I hate this place.
Ki-Woo gets up, still unsure, when --
VOICE (O.S.)
HEY, MISTER!
A VOICE booms from afar. Behind the Drunk Man, we see a 
handsome, well-built young man climbing off a fancy scooter. 
This is MIN-HYUK, 24. He walks over with a LARGE BOX in his 
hands. 
KI-JUNG
Is that Min-Hyuk?
CHUNG-SOOK
It is.
Ki-Woo is surprised to see Min-Hyuk, who continues to yell at 
the would-be public urinater. 
7. MIN-HYUK
What do you think you’re doing? 
You think this is a public toilet? 
DRUNK MAN
I, uh--
MIN-HYUK
What are you looking at!
Cowed by Min-Hyuk’s presence, the Drunk Man quickly skedaddles 
away. 
Ki-Tek taps Ki-Woo on the shoulder. 
KI-TEK
Your friend has mucho cajones. 
CHUNG-SOOK
It’s that college student glow. 
Look at that confidence.
KI-JUNG
Which Ki-Woo obviously doesn’t 
have. 
A smitten Ki-Jung admires Min-Hyuk as he walks over to the 
apartment. He enters. 
MIN-HYUK
How are you, Mr. and Mrs. Kim! 
KI-TEK
Min-Hyuk! Good to see you, son!
KI-WOO
What’s with the surprise 
appearance?
MIN-HYUK
I texted you.
(to Ki-Jung)
Hey, Ki-Jung.
Ki-Jung smiles shyly as she nods. 
Ki-Woo searches through his text messages. 
KI-WOO
We could have met somewhere else. 
You didn’t have to come all this 
way. 
MIN-HYUK
I brought this. 
8. Min-Hyuk shows Ki-Woo the box. 
MIN-HYUK (CONT’D)
It’s heavy so I had to bring it on 
my bike. 
KI-JUNG
What’s this?
Ki-Jung lifts the flap to see a UNIQUELY SHAPED STONE and a 
wooden display stand inside. 
MIN-HYUK
(to Ki-Tek)
When I told my grandfather I was 
going to see Ki-Woo, he gave me 
this. 
KI-TEK
Whoa. 
Ki-Tek picks up the large stone.
KI-TEK (CONT’D)
This is a precious viewing stone. 
Is this an abstract specimen? 
MIN-HYUK
You know your stones, Mr. Kim. 
Pop-Pop’s been collecting viewing 
stones since his academy days. 
Our house is literally filled with 
these things -- living room, 
study, basement... This one is 
supposed to bring luck. And 
money. 
KI-WOO
How perfect for us. Symbolic. 
KI-TEK
Yes, how serendipitous. Please 
send him our sincere regards. 
CHUNG-SOOK
(to herself)
He should’ve brought food.
Ki-Jung stabs Chung-Sook with her finger. Fortunately Min-Hyuk 
didn’t hear. 
As a beaming Ki-Tek continues to show off useless stone trivia 
-- 
9. 6 6
CUT TO:
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STORE - NIGHT 
Min-Hyuk and Ki-Woo sit at a portable table outside the store, 
drinking soju and chasing it with chips. Min-Hyuk’s expensive 
foreign scooter is parked behind him. It visually clashes with 
the old grocery store and run-down alley. 
MIN-HYUK
I had to bring that stupid rock, 
but it was nice to see your folks. 
They look good. 
KI-WOO
They’re not as good as they look. 
They’re all jobless. 
MIN-HYUK
Ki-Jung’s at home too? She 
doesn’t take college prep classes? 
KI-WOO
It’s not that she doesn’t want to. 
She can’t. 
Ki-Woo downs a shot of soju. 
Min-Hyuk looks at Ki-Woo. He has something to say. He takes 
out his phone and shows Ki-Woo -- 
A picture of a brightly smiling TEENAGE GIRL. High school 
uniform. Innocent. 
MIN-HYUK
Cute, right?
KI-WOO
Is that her? The girl you’re 
tutoring?
Min-Hyuk nods.
MIN-HYUK
Park Da-Hae. A sophomore. I want 
you to tutor her. Take over for 
me as her English teacher. 
KI-WOO
That makes no sense. 
MIN-HYUK
Her family’s loaded. The gig pays 
really well. 
10. That gets Ki-Woo’s attention. He looks at the picture again. 
MIN-HYUK (CONT’D)
She’s a good kid. I want you to 
look after her until I come back 
from the study-abroad program. 
KI-WOO
You have plenty of friends at 
school. Why do you want a highschool grad to teach your prized 
student? 
MIN-HYUK
Why do you think? I shudder just 
thinking about those femalestarved engineering students 
drooling around her like hungry 
wolves. It’s revolting. 
Ki-Woo studies Min-Hyuk.
KI-WOO
(laughs)
You like her, don’t you?
MIN-HYUK
(nods)
I’m serious about her. I’m going 
to ask her out in two years, once 
she’s in college. I want you to 
take care of her while I’m gone. 
I trust you. 
KI-WOO
I appreciate the trust, but you 
want me to pretend I’m a college 
student? 
MIN-HYUK
Ki-Woo, think about it. How many 
times have you taken the college 
entrance exam? Twice before your 
military service and twice after 
-- a grand total of four times. 
Grammar, vocabulary, composition, 
speaking. You’re an English 
master. Far more qualified as a 
tutor than I am. Better than 
those spoiled college brats who 
drown their brain cells in booze 
everyday. 
KI-WOO
That may be true but-- You think 
the family would accept me? I’m 
not even a college student.
11. 7 7
MIN-HYUK
We’ll embellish a little. You’ll 
be fine. You’ll have my 
recommendation. And the mother is 
a bit-- 
Min-Hyuk picks up his glass to drink when he suddenly becomes 
thoughtful. He smiles. 
MIN-HYUK (CONT’D)
She’s simple. Young. And simple. 
KI-WOO
(English)
Simple? What do you mean?
MIN-HYUK
(English)
I don’t know. Just simple. 
Min-Hyuk and Ki-Woo start conversing in English for no reason. 
They’re fluent. 
MIN-HYUK (CONT’D)
I hear Ki-Jung is handy with 
Photoshop.
INT. INTERNET CAFÉ - DAY 
Ki-Jung is working at the computer, clicking the mouse and 
tapping various keyboard shortcuts with dizzying speed. She’s 
like a magician. On the monitor is a document -- 
“Certificate of Enrollment.” 
With laser focus, Ki-Jung refines the edges of the red 
certification seal. 
KI-WOO
This is amazing. How come you 
keep failing the art school exam? 
KI-JUNG
Shut up, dickwad. 
The siblings work discreetly in the corner of the large 
internet café. 
KI-WOO
Take your time. 
(looking around)
We should hold off on the printing 
until the place clears out. 
12. 8 8
9 9
INT. SEMI-BASEMENT - DAY 
Ki-Tek is on the floor laying his head on the viewing stone. 
He admires the freshly printed enrollment certificate. 
KI-TEK
Look at this. There should be a 
major for document forgery at 
Seoul National University. KiJung would be top of the class. 
CHUNG-SOOK
Shut up and wish the boy good luck 
for his interview.
KI-TEK
My son--
Ki-Tek sits up. 
KI-TEK (CONT’D)
I’m so proud of you. 
A slightly awkward and embarrassing moment. They all know KiWoo did nothing to be proud of.
Ki-Woo finishes touching up his hair in front of the mirror. 
He picks up the fake certificate. 
KI-WOO
I don’t consider this a crime. 
No. Because I plan on going to 
this school next year. 
KI-TEK
That’s my son. Man with a plan.
KI-WOO
I’m just using some of their 
administrative services in 
advance. 
EXT. RICH NEIGHBORHOOD - ROAD - DAY 
A quiet road snaking up the hill of a wealthy neighborhood. 
High walls. Not a pedestrian in sight. Except Ki-Woo, who 
consults the map on his phone as he walks up the hill, backpack 
strapped. He looks around. Walks faster. 
13. 10 10
11 11
EXT. MANSION - GATE - DAY 
Ki-Woo stands in front of the gate, which is at the top of a 
steep stairway. He waits through the MELODIC DOORBELL until a 
VOICE finally answers. The voice is middle-aged, female. 
FEMALE VOICE (SPEAKER)
Who is it?
KI-WOO
Mrs. Park? Hi, I’m Min-Hyuk’s 
friend--
FEMALE VOICE (SPEAKER)
Oh, hello. Please come in. 
CLANK. The gate is unlocked, and Ki-Woo walks into --
A GORGEOUSLY MANICURED GARDEN LINED WITH MAJESTIC TREES
Ki-Woo stops midway and admires the trees, overcome with awe. 
MUN-KWANG (O.S.)
Quite a view, isn’t it?
KI-WOO
Mrs. Park, pleasure to meet you.
MUN-KWANG
Oh, no. I’m the housekeeper. 
Please follow me. 
MUN-KWANG, 45, fashionable and poised enough to be mistaken for 
the owner, leads Ki-Woo inside. 
KI-WOO
Stunning garden. 
MUN-KWANG
The inside is even more stunning. 
INT. MANSION - DAY 
Ki-Woo carefully follows Mun-Kwang inside. Indeed, the 
interior is stunning. But not excessive. The furniture and 
decorations are all tasteful. 
MUN-KWANG
Do you know Namgoong Hyunja? The 
famous Korean-French architect?
Ki-woo is blank. 
14. MUN-KWANG (CONT’D)
This used to be his house. He 
built it. 
KI-WOO
I see. 
MUN-KWANG
Now it’s just Da-Hae’s house. 
Mun-Kwang stops just short of the fabulous living room 
overlooking the garden, arriving at the equally fabulous and 
spacious --
KITCHEN / DINING ROOM
She seats Ki-Woo at the large wooden table. 
MUN-KWANG (CONT’D)
Please wait here. I’ll get Mrs. 
Park. 
Mun-Kwang exits, and Ki-Woo is left alone in silence. He 
quietly gets up and looks around. 
There’s some kind of AVANT-GARDE ART hanging on the wall. Next 
to it, he sees a typical Korean FAMILY PORTRAIT taken at a 
studio. 
Ki-Woo walks over to the window, which overlooks the backyard. 
He sees --
A WOMAN dozing off at the patio table. English magazine open 
on the table. Head tilted comically. Only her soft white neck 
is visible. This is YON-KYO, 41. 
Mun-Kwang walks over and CLAPS her hands loudly next to YonKyo’s ears. 
Yon-Kyo sucks her drool in and slowly raises her head. We hear 
their muffled voices through the window. 
MUN-KWANG (CONT’D)
The tutor is here. 
YON-KYO
What do you think of him? 
MUN-KWANG
(smiles)
I don’t know, but he’s handsome. 
15. 12 INT. MANSION - KITCHEN - DAY 12
Yon-Kyo sits with Ki-Woo at the dining table. She pulls out 
the fake certificate halfway, glimpses at it, then puts it back 
in.
Ki-Woo is nervous. Even the DOG, cradled in Yon-Kyo’s arms, is 
watching him. Panting. Disapproving. 
YON-KYO
I don’t care about papers. I only 
wanted to see you because you were 
recommended by Min-Hyuk. I guess 
you two are good friends. 
Ki-Woo listens quietly. 
YON-KYO (CONT’D)
I’m sure you know better than I 
do, but Min-Hyuk is just the most 
brilliant human being. I don’t 
even care about the grades. DaHae and I absolutely adored him. 
Do you know what I mean? 
KI-WOO
Of course.
YON-KYO
We just loved him so much. I 
wanted him to stay with Da-Hae 
through her college exams next 
year, but now he’s leaving to 
study abroad and I’m suddenly left 
without a tutor. I mean, what am 
I supposed to do?
Ki-Woo listens, respectful. 
YON-KYO (CONT’D)
Excuse my bluntness, but I just 
don’t see the point of hiring 
someone unless he’s as utterly 
outstanding as Min-Hyuk, you know?
Mun-Kwang sneaks a glance at Ki-Woo as she brings coffee over 
to the table, checking him out. 
CLINK. She sets it down loudly in front of Ki-Woo.
YON-KYO (CONT’D)
I guess what I wanted to ask was 
-- Would it be okay if I sat in 
for today’s class? I want to see 
the whole thing. Judge for 
myself. I would like to see your 
-- methods. 
16. 13 13
14 14
KI-WOO
Uh... 
YON-KYO
(English)
Is that okay with you?
Yon-Kyo suddenly blurts out a question in English. Her English 
is terrible. 
INT. MANSION - STAIRCASE - DAY 
Ki-Woo follows Yon-Kyo up the large, oppressive staircase, 
trying his best not look at her conspicuously swaying hips. He 
arrives on the second floor where he sees --
A long hallway with several doors on each side. 
INT. MANSION - DA-HAE’S ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON 
A large, pretty room. Yon-Kyo and her dog are sitting on the 
bed watching Ki-Woo. 
The attention doesn’t bother Ki-Woo, who is calmly focused on 
DA-HAE as she works through a practice test. 
KI-WOO
Are you sure about question 14?
DA-HAE
(hesitant)
Is it wrong?
KI-WOO
I’m asking you. What does your 
gut say? Do you think number 14 
is right? 
Da-Hae shrinks. 
KI-WOO (CONT’D)
You were working on other 
questions before you came back to 
14. Am I right?
DA-HAE
Yes. 
Ki-Woo suddenly snatches Da-Hae’s wrist, shocking both Da-Hae 
and her mom. He presses his thumb gently and feels her pulse 
like doctor. 
17. KI-WOO
If this was a real test and number 
14 was the first question, you 
would’ve been in trouble from the 
start.
He presses harder. 
KI-WOO (CONT’D)
See? You pulse is irregular. 
Your heart doesn’t lie. 
Da-Hae turns bright red. Yon-Kyo is speechless, either 
appalled or in awe. 
KI-WOO (CONT’D)
What are you supposed to do in a 
test? You move forward. You need 
to seize the flow. The rhythm. 
If not, you’re screwed. I don’t 
care about question number 14. I 
only care about how you seize the 
flow. How you conquer the test as 
a whole. You get it? 
Da-Hae is quiet. 
KI-WOO (CONT’D)
A test is all about confidence. 
(English)
Attitude. 
Stunned silence. Ki-Woo finally lets go of Da-Hae’s wrist, 
revealing a round, pink spot where he held her.
Ki-Woo looks over at Yon-Kyo. She’s completely floored. 
KI-WOO (CONT’D)
I know. You were angry. 
Frustrated. You worked so hard. 
Studied until your nose bled. But 
your test scores weren’t 
improving. You keep asking 
yourself, ‘What am I doing wrong?’
That triggers something in Da-Hae. Emotions swell, and her 
pupils tremble. 
KI-WOO (CONT’D)
I’m here to prepare you for the 
real thing. I’m not here to help 
you learn. I’m here to help you 
score. 
18. 15 INT. MANSION - KITCHEN - EVENING 15
CLOSE ON a thick money envelope being handed to Ki-Woo.
YON-KYO
I’ll pay you each month on this 
day. As for the lesson, I was 
thinking three times a week? 
Monday, Wednesday, Friday? 
KI-WOO
That sounds good. 
YON-KYO
It’s a little more than what MinHyuk used to get. Cost of living 
and so forth. 
KI-WOO
Thank you. 
As Ki-Woo puts away the envelope, Mun-Kwang brings over a fruit 
plate. She’s noticeably friendlier than before. 
YON-KYO
(to Mun-Kwang)
I guess it’s time to get to know 
each other. Mr. Kevin will be DaHae’s English teacher. 
MUN-KWANG
Of course! Mr. Kevin, you let me 
know if you need anything at all 
during your lessons -- snacks, 
drinks, whatever. 
KI-WOO
I appreciate it. 
YON-KYO
Feel free to pester her if you 
need anything in this house. 
She’s the expert. She knows it 
better than I do. 
They continue exchanging pleasantries when -- 
THUNK. A PLASTIC ARROW flies in and hits Mun-Kwang’s shoulder. 
When Ki-Woo looks over -- 
It’s a boy in a Native American costume about to shoot another 
arrow. This is DA-SONG, 10, the youngest Park. 
YON-KYO (CONT’D)
Da-Song! Behave yourself. We 
have a guest! 
19. Da-Song doesn’t care. He continues shooting. 
Mun-Kwang is used to the antics. She picks up an arrow and 
rubs it in her armpit. 
MUN-KWANG
(silly laugh)
Armpit attack! 
DA-SONG
No!! It stinks! 
Da-Song plucks a TOY AXE from his belt and starts running in 
‘slow motion’ toward Mun-Kwang. He screams like a warrior. 
Mun-Kwang does the same, flailing in fake slow motion. They 
make quite a pair. 
YON-KYO
(sighs)
I apologize. Our son is a little 
--unique.
KI-WOO
Unique is good. 
YON-KYO
He has trouble focusing. ADHD. 
We signed him up for the Cub 
Scouts hoping the discipline would 
help, but he’s become an even 
bigger weirdo. Now he’s obsessed 
with Indians-- 
KI-WOO
(laughs)
The Scouts have roots in American 
Indian culture, so he has the 
right idea. 
YON-KYO
You were a Scout too?
KI-WOO
Yes, I learned a lot as a Scout. 
YON-KYO
Look how fine you turned out. 
What’s wrong with him?
(then, serious)
He’s actually an art prodigy, you 
know. Did you see the drawings?
(re: pictures on the wall)
Those are his. 
20. 16 16
Ki-Woo turns toward the AVANT-GARDE DRAWINGS on the wall. He 
gazes for a long moment. 
KI-WOO
A lot of symbolism. Such strong 
point of view. 
YON-KYO
Right? Strong. I knew you would 
get it, Mr. Kevin. 
Ki-Woo takes a couple of steps back and admires the drawings 
with a serious face. 
KI-WOO
I see. It’s an interpretation of 
a chimpanzee.
YON-KYO
It’s a self-portrait. 
Awkward. Crickets chirp as Da-Song and Mun-Kwang continue to 
battle it out in the background. 
KI-WOO
Of course. Us grown-ups are too 
jaded to see true genius. 
EXT. MANSION - GARDEN - EVENING 
YON-KYO
That must be why. We’ve gone 
through dozens of art teachers. 
They never last more than a month. 
Of course Da-Song is a bit much to 
handle.
Ki-Woo nods. 
Yon-Kyo has come to see him out with the dog in her arms.
The gate opens. Ki-Woo begins to step out when he stops. 
KI-WOO
Actually... Mrs. Park.
YON-KYO
Yes?
KI-WOO
Someone just happened to come to 
my mind. Her name is-- 
21. 17 17
Through Yon-Kyo’s POV, we see the back of Ki-Woo’s head as he 
seemingly tries to remember. 
KI-WOO (CONT’D)
Girl’s Generation. The girl 
group. What was her name -- the 
one who started the jewelry brand? 
YON-KYO
Jessica?
KI-WOO
Right! Jessica. My cousin has a 
school friend named Jessica. I 
don’t know her Korean name. She 
studied applied arts at Illinois 
State and recently moved back to 
Korea. 
YON-KYO
Ah, Illinois State. What about 
her? 
KI-WOO
She also tutors, and she’s known 
to have a very unique approach to 
teaching art. Most of all, she 
knows how to handle kids. 
YON-KYO
(interested)
Is that so?
KI-WOO
She’s a bit of a celebrity in 
tutoring circles. Her style is a 
little unorthodox, but it still 
gets kids into good art schools. 
YON-KYO
She sounds fantastic. I’m so 
curious. 
KI-WOO
Would you be interested in meeting 
her? She’s very busy so I’m not 
sure if I’ll be able to get an 
appointment-- 
INT. HAIR SALON - DAY 
KI-JUNG
Jessica? 
(laughs)
Why Jessica. So tacky.
22. 18 18
Ki-Jung is getting her hair done at the neighborhood shop. 
Ki-Woo is sucking on a popsicle on the sofa behind her. 
KI-WOO
It has a nice ring. Anyhow. 
She’s a nice lady. Young. Not 
the brightest tool in the shed. 
The money is good, and most of 
all, she’s a ‘believer.’
CHUNG-SOOK
She’s religious? 
TRACK BACK TO REVEAL -- Chung-Sook and Ki-Tek sitting next to 
Ki-Jung, also getting their hairs trimmed.
KI-WOO
No, it’s just-- She tends to 
trust people rather easily. 
They become thoughtful. Ki-Tek breaks the silence. 
KI-TEK
She sounds like a great lady.
KI-WOO
Right?
CHUNG-SOOK
Yeah.
The family members all nod. A strange excitement appears on 
their faces. 
EXT. MANSION - GATE - LATE AFTERNOON 
Ki-Woo and Ki-Jung both take a deep breath in front of the 
gate. Ki-Jung looks like a completely new person with short, 
stylish hair and makeup. 
Ki-Woo is about to ring the doorbell when Ki-Jung stops him. 
She suddenly starts clapping a beat with her hands. 
KI-JUNG
(singing)
Jessica, only child, Chicago 
Illinois / My classmate Jin-Mo is 
cousin of Kevin
She sings her ‘bio’ to the tune of a catchy Korean oldie. KiWoo joins. Silly. Ridiculous. But you can sense a real 
sibling bond. 
23. 19 19
20 20
Finally Ki-Woo presses the button, and the DOORBELL rings 
throughout the quiet neighborhood. 
INT. MANSION - KITCHEN - EVENING 
We find Da-Song at the bottom of the stairs peeking inside the 
kitchen where --
Yon-Kyo is interviewing Ki-Jung. They talk quietly. Formal. 
Serious. Ki-Woo sits a few feet away. 
Da-Hae tiptoes down from second floor and sees Da-Song peeking. 
She flicks his forehead and sends him upstairs. 
She then looks inside the kitchen herself. She focuses on KiJung, scrutinizing, suspicious. 
KI-WOO
I should go upstairs for my 
lesson. I’ll let you two talk. 
(to Ki-Jung)
Jessica, nice meeting you. 
Ki-Woo gets up and nods to Ki-Jung. 
KI-WOO (CONT’D)
I’ll see you next time. 
Ki-Jung also stands up, cordial. 
KI-JUNG
Thank you, Kevin. 
Da-Hae sees Ki-Woo coming and runs back up the stairs. 
INT. MANSION - DA-HAE’S ROOM - EVENING 
Da-Hae hurries back to her desk and pretends to work on her 
problems. 
The door opens, and Ki-Woo enters. He sits next to Da-Hae. 
KI-WOO
Where did we leave off? Number 
17?
DA-HAE
You know--
KI-WOO
What is it?
DA-HAE
You know it’s all an act, right? 
My brother. 
24. KI-WOO
What are you talking about?
DA-HAE
It’s all fake. Acting all 
bizarro. Like he’s a crazed 
artist. He’s a big fraud. 
KI-WOO
Da-Song?
DA-HAE
You know, like he would stop in 
the middle of the street and 
pretend he was struck by a sudden 
inspiration. 
KI-WOO
(laughs)
Randomly stare up at the clouds 
and ponder the shapes? Something 
like that? 
DA-HAE
Exactly! He’s the worst! And he 
acts like he can’t behave normal. 
Like he’s completely perplexed. 
Makes me want to puke. 
KI-WOO
So Da-Song is a fraud. What does 
that have to do with your English 
problems?
Dae-Hae pouts when Ki-Woo suddenly returns to tutor mode. 
DA-HAE
I’m just saying. 
KI-WOO
Good. Now those were all great 
descriptions of Da-Song. Why 
don’t we use them to compose a 
paragraph in English? You must 
use the word ‘pretend’ at least 
twice. 
Ki-Woo, master tutor, skillfully guides the conversation back 
to the lesson. 
But Da-Hae still has something on her mind. She puts down her 
pen. 
DA-HAE
Can I ask you something?
25. KI-WOO
What now?
DA-HAE
The teacher downstairs. Ms. 
Jessica. Is she really your 
cousin’s friend?
This catches Ki-Woo off guard. He disguises it with a smile.
KI-WOO
I don’t know what you’re talking 
about.
DA-HAE
She’s your girlfriend, isn’t she?
Ki-Woo relaxes and laughs. He looks at Da-Hae, who is all 
worried and serious. She’s cute. 
KI-WOO
Come on. I just met her today. 
DA-HAE
(pouting)
She’s very pretty. Not even 
interested?
KI-WOO
She is pretty. A beauty even.
DA-HAE
I knew it. You are interested. 
KI-WOO
If you were a perfect ten, maybe 
she would be a six? Six-pointfive?
A cheesy line, but Da-Hae smiles, pleased. Suddenly, she grabs 
Ki-Woo’s wrist under the desk. She presses it gently, feeling 
his pulse. A bold, unexpected move on her part.
Ki-Woo stares quietly at Da-Hae. Slowly, they grow closer. 
Lips converge. A soft, gentle kiss held through silence until 
-- 
They hear FOOTSTEPS coming up the stairs. 
KI-WOO (CONT’D)
Let’s study.
DA-HAE
Right. 
26. 21 INT. MANSION - 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY - EVENING 21
Yon-Kyo and Ki-Jung pass Da-Hae’s room and walk toward DaSong’s. Yon-Kyo turns to Ki-Jung, nervous.
YON-KYO
I should tell you. He’s not good 
at staying in one place. 
(apologetic)
I hope you understand--
KI-JUNG
It’s fine. 
Ki-Jung has no expression. Nothing fazes her. Yon-Kyo 
hesitates before finally opening the door to reveal -- 
DA-SONG’S ROOM
A huge clutter. Covered with Da-Song’s drawings as well as 
pictures of Native American tribesmen. All kinds of Indianthemed toys. A TEEPEE TENT imported from America. 
Da-Song is lying on the floor with a toy arrow tucked between 
his legs. Staring at the ceiling. In his own world. This may 
also be an act. 
KI-JUNG (CONT’D)
Would you mind leaving?
YON-KYO
Excuse me?
KI-JUNG
I don’t allow parents to sit in 
during lessons. 
Yon-Kyo is surprised. She continues to linger, but Ki-Jung’s 
stare is unwavering.
YON-KYO
I just thought, since it’s the 
first day-- As you can see, the 
boy is a bit--
KI-JUNG
You should wait downstairs. 
Yon-Kyo finally backs down, subdued by Ki-Jung’s authority. 
She walks out of the room. 
27. 22 INT. MANSION - KITCHEN - NIGHT 22
TICK TOCK TICK TOCK. 
Yon-Kyo and Mun-Kwang nibble on nuts as they pass time in the 
kitchen. The dog licks Yon-Kyo’s face, which is full of agony, 
worry, curiosity. 
Mun-Kwang sees Yon-Kyo’s state -- 
MUN-KWANG
Would you like some plum extract? 
I can add some honey. It’ll help 
you relax.
YON-KYO
What? Oh. Sure. 
Mun-Kwang walks down a narrow set of stairs to the -- 
STORAGE BASEMENT
Stocked with all kinds of foods, beverages, and other household 
necessities. On one side is a cabinet filled with numerous 
GLASS JARS -- hand-extracted plum, tangerine, and fig 
concentrates. Mun-Kwang picks up the plum bottle and twists 
the tightly locked lid when -- 
Yon-Kyo hurtles down the stairs. 
YON-KYO (CONT’D)
I have an idea! This is what 
we’ll do!
MUN-KWANG
What?
YON-KYO
You’ll take two plum juices to DaSong’s room. You’re not a parent 
so you can go in. You’ll just be 
delivering the drinks. 
MUN-KWANG
You’re right. I’ll take a quick 
peek and let you know how they’re 
doing. 
YON-KYO
Dammit. Why didn’t I think of 
this before?
MOMENTS LATER --
28. Mun-Kwang and Yon-Kyo hurry back up the steps with a cup of 
plum extract. They are startled to see -- 
Ki-Jung and Da-Song waiting in the kitchen, already done with 
their lesson. 
Yon-Kyo tries to hide her surprise.
YON-KYO (CONT’D)
You guys are... done?
Ki-Jung is holding a picture drawn by Da-Song. Da-Song is 
standing politely behind her. 
KI-JUNG
Mrs. Park, will you please have a 
seat?
YON-KYO
(nervous)
Sure.
KI-JUNG
Da-Song, you go up. 
Yon-Kyo and Mun-Kwang are stunned to see --
Da-Song obediently bowing and heading up the stairs. What?!
Ki-Jung hands Yon-Kyo the drawing. 
KI-JUNG (CONT’D)
Da-Song drew this today. 
Yon-Kyo is scared. She has no idea what’s going on. 
Ki-Jung clocks Mun-Kwang peeking over Yon-Kyo’s shoulders.
KI-JUNG (CONT’D)
I’d like to speak to you alone. 
YON-KYO
Oh, this is--
KI-JUNG
Can you please give us a moment? 
Yon-Kyo’s voice falters at Ki-Jung’s ice-cold demeanor. 
Mun-Kwang stares hard at Ki-Jung before walking away. 
KI-JUNG (CONT’D)
I mentioned earlier that I’m also 
studying art therapy.
YON-KYO
Yes, I remember-- 
29. KI-JUNG
(re: drawing)
Did something happen to Da-Song 
when he was in first grade?
Yon-Kyo yelps loudly! She quickly covers her mouth. Her hands 
start shaking. 
KI-JUNG (CONT’D)
I feel a bit cautious about 
bringing this up -- it’s the first 
day after all -- but I’ll need to 
know what happened to Da-Song in 
order to truly understand him. 
YON-KYO
When he was in first grade--
(tearful)
I’m sorry. I don’t know if I can 
talk about this right now. 
KI-JUNG
It’s fine. We can talk about it 
later. 
Ki-Jung puts a finger on the drawing. 
KI-JUNG (CONT’D)
Here. This lower section is 
what’s called the ‘schizophrenia 
zone’ in psychology. It contains 
clues about the mental state of 
the child. Do you see this 
particular shape drawn here?
YON-KYO
Yes. Yes, I do.
Yon-Kyo suddenly looks up from the drawing and stares at the 
large framed picture on the wall.
YON-KYO (CONT’D)
My gosh! It’s in the other 
drawing too! Same spot! 
Ki-Jung looks back at the picture. 
KI-JUNG
Yes. Same spot, same pattern. 
Yon-Kyo nods fervently. She sobs harder. She feels like a 
horrible mother. 
30. YON-KYO
I see that picture everyday. 
Every time I eat. 
(sobs)
I had no idea.
KI-JUNG
You don’t have to beat yourself 
up. These drawings are records of 
Da-Song’s emotions. A black box 
of his soul. I’d like to try and 
unlock that box. But I’ll need 
time. 
YON-KYO
Of course. Please take as much 
time as you need. I can wait.
KI-JUNG
(calm)
I suggest four two-hour sessions a 
week -- Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, 
Friday. This is different from 
regular tutoring -- it’s art 
therapy -- so I would need to be 
compensated at a higher rate. 
YON-KYO
Of course. I understand. 
Ki-Jung continues her performance as multi-certified art 
teacher and therapist Jessica when --
We hear a car pull into the garage. Moments later, DONG-IK 
PARK, 45, Yon-Kyo’s husband and Da-Song’s father, emerges from 
the stairs next to the front entrance. 
We notice the AUTOMATED MOTION-SENSOR LIGHTS blinking above the 
main entrance as Dong-Ik walks in. 
YUN, 31, the driver, follows up with Dong-Ik’s things. 
YON-KYO (CONT’D)
Oh--
Yon-Kyo wipes her tears.
YON-KYO (CONT’D)
Dong-Ik. Say hi to Ms. Jessica, 
Da-Song’s new art teacher. She 
just started today.
(to Jessica; in English)
Jessica, this is Dong-Ik.
KI-JUNG
(curt)
Hello. 
31. 23 23
Dong-Ik looks tired. But even the fatigue adds to his mystique 
and cool as a high-flying CEO. He shares a brief handshake 
with Ki-Jung. 
DONG-IK
Thank you for helping Da-Song.
(to Yon-Kyo)
Are they done for the day? 
YON-KYO
Yes, they just finished.
DONG-IK
(to Yun)
Sorry Yun, but are you busy 
tonight? Would you mind taking 
Ms. Jessica home? I don’t want 
her walking down the hill alone at 
night.
INT. DONG-IK’S CAR - DRIVING - NIGHT 
Ki-Jung sits quietly in the back. She looks quite natural in 
the backseat of the swanky Mercedes. 
Yun sneaks glances at Ki-Jung through the rearview mirror. 
YUN
Where do you live, Ms. Jessica? I 
might as well just drive you 
home-- 
KI-JUNG
It’s fine. Just drop me off at 
Hyehwa Station. Thank you.
Ki-Jung’s cold demeanor intrigues Yun instead of putting him 
off. He’s attracted. He tries again. 
YUN
Doesn’t matter if it’s far. I’m 
done for the day--
KI-JUNG
I’ll get off at Hyehwa. 
Yun looks out the window.
YUN
It looks like it’s about to rain. 
I bet the Mercedes is way better 
than the subway--
32. 24 24
KI-JUNG
(cutting him off)
No. I’m supposed to meet my 
boyfriend at the station.
YUN
I see.
Yun’s smile disappears. He quietly turns the steering wheel. 
Ki-Jung stares at the back of Yun’s head, thinking. Then --
She slowly reaches under her skirt and starts rolling down her 
underwear!
Her eyes twinkle in the dark as she holds the removed underwear 
in her hands. 
INT. BUFFET RESTAURANT - DAY 
KI-JUNG
Did you drive Benzes when you were 
a designated driver? 
KI-TEK
Not when I was at the designated 
driver service. I drove a lot of 
them when I was a valet. 
KI-JUNG
When were you a valet?
CHUNG-SOOK
After the fried chicken and before 
the Taiwanese Castella. About six 
months, I’d say?
KI-TEK
Nah. It was after the Castella 
shop went bust. 
Ki-Tek and family stack food onto their already mountainous 
plates as they move along the buffet line. They’re at a large 
budget restaurant frequented by BUS AND TAXI DRIVERS. 
Ki-Woo makes sure no one is listening before -- 
KI-WOO
We’re already starting Phase 
Three?
KI-JUNG
I planted a little trap in the 
Mercedes. We’ll see if he bites.
33. KI-WOO
Then it’s begun. 
(looking around)
Father, how amazing is this? We 
just so happen to be eating at a 
buffet for drivers. How symbolic! 
Ki-Tek doesn’t get it but beams anyway. 
KI-TEK
This place IS amazing! You guys 
eat as much as you want! 
CHUNG-SOOK
You’re not even buying, you big 
bum. They are. 
Ki-Tek is still happy. He’s grown immune to Chung-Sook’s 
insults. 
KI-TEK
Here.
He puts some of his meat on Ki-Woo’s plate. 
KI-TEK (CONT’D)
Have some of this, Son.
KI-WOO
Thanks, Dad!
(to Ki-Jung)
By the way, what did you say to 
Mrs. Park yesterday? 
KI-JUNG
Why?
KI-WOO
She was over the moon about you. 
Saying that you were a godsend. A 
freaking miracle FedExed from 
heaven. 
KI-JUNG
(laughs)
I just googled ‘art therapy’ and 
did a little improv, and she just 
lost her shit. Started crying 
like a baby. Can’t believe how 
gullible she is. 
34. 25 25
26 26
INT. DONG-IK’S CAR - DRIVING - NIGHT 
Dong-Ik is going through some papers in the back when one drops 
under the seat. As he reaches down to grab it -- 
He sees a vague WHITE SHAPE beneath the passenger seat. He 
picks it up. A pair of women’s underwear. Ki-Jung’s. 
Dong-Ik looks disgusted. He stares hard at the back of Yun’s 
head before putting the underwear in his pocket. 
INT. MANSION - ENTRANCE - NIGHT 
Dong-Ik rushes up the garage stairs. He passes the blinking 
motion-sensor lights and stomps toward the --
KITCHEN 
YON-KYO
What’s wrong? Something happen?
Dong-Ik checks to see if the kids are around.
DONG-IK
It’s Yun. That son of a bitch. I 
found this under the car seat. 
Dong-Ik pulls out the panties from his pocket.
Yon-Kyo gasps, shocked. Perhaps more outraged than necessary. 
DONG-IK (CONT’D)
You pay him well, don’t you? He 
doesn’t have money to go to a 
hotel? Is he saving that money 
for something?
YON-KYO
Maybe he’s a sexual deviant? He 
might get off on doing it in his 
boss’ car. 
Yon-Kyo sees -- Dong-Ik is in no mood. 
YON-KYO (CONT’D)
I’m sorry, babe. I had no idea 
that he was such a perv. 
DONG-IK
I don’t care who or what he 
screws. That’s his business. I 
get it. He’s a young guy. 
 (MORE)
35. DONG-IK (CONT’D)
But why does he have to do it in 
my car? And why in the backseat? 
That’s my space. Is he trying to 
mark his territory? With his 
dirty cum stains? Son of a bitch 
crossed the line. 
Yon-Kyo doesn’t know what to do. Her husband rarely gets this 
upset. 
Dong-Ik calms down and looks at the underwear. 
DONG-IK (CONT’D)
(quiet)
You know what’s even weirder?
YON-KYO
(nervous)
What?
DONG-IK
Don’t you see? Think about it.
Yon-Kyo is freaked out of her mind. 
DONG-IK (CONT’D)
So they have sex in the car. It’s 
not unusual to leave behind a few 
strands of hair, maybe an earring. 
But how do you forget your 
underwear?
YON-KYO
It’s true. You don’t just forget 
to put on your knickers. 
DONG-IK
That’s why. I’m more concerned by 
his -- partner. Her mental state. 
Do you know what I mean?
Dong-Ik checks the surroundings before whispering something in 
Yon-Kyo’s ear.
YON-KYO
NOOOO--
(turning pale)
Like methamphetamine? Cocaine? 
DONG-IK
Shhhh!
YON-KYO
What do we do? If they find some 
kind of white powder in your car, 
we’re all doomed! 
36. DONG-IK
Calm down, babe. Relax. We don’t 
want to go too far. Not yet. For 
now it’s just a suspicion. A 
well-founded one. 
As the Parks continue to fret over the panties, CAMERA BOOMS UP 
TO REVEAL --
Ki-Jung standing on the stairs with her bag, listening to the 
conversation. 
DONG-IK (CONT’D)
We can’t even take something like 
this to the police. And it would 
look ridiculous if I tried to 
interrogate him. What would I 
say? “Yun, did you have sexual 
intercourse in my car?” 
(then)
That’s why I was thinking--
YON-KYO
Yes, dear. 
DONG-IK
You have to take care of this. 
Come up with some kind of bland, 
harmless reason. Let him go 
quietly. Don’t even mention the 
panties. Or the intercourse. 
YON-KYO
I understand. We don’t want the 
neighborhood birds gossiping about 
the Parks’ driver sexing up the 
boss’ car. 
DONG-IK
Exactly. Our names will forever 
be linked with his disgusting 
behavior. 
Yon-Kyo nods, then thinks.
YON-KYO
You don’t think Yun would post 
something online, do you? Go on a 
Twitter vendetta? He could 
announce to the whole world that 
he was unfairly fired by a famous 
tech CEO. 
37. 27 27
DONG-IK
We’ll pay him severance. Enough 
to keep him quiet. Just choose 
your words carefully when you let 
him go. Then we’ll be fine. 
Just then Ki-Jung starts walking down the stairs. Stepping 
loudly so the Parks can hear. 
Yon-Kyo leaps out of her seat. Dong-Ik quickly hides the 
underwear and puts on an awkward smile. 
YON-KYO
(smiling)
Are you guys done? How was DaSong today?
EXT. MANSION - GARDEN - NIGHT 
Yon-Kyo and Ki-Jung walk toward the gate. Yon-Kyo sidles up to 
Ki-Jung, acting friendlier than usual. 
YON-KYO
Ms. Jessica, I wanted to ask. The 
other night, when Yun took you 
home...
KI-JUNG
Yes?
YON-KYO
This may sound weird but-- Did 
anything happen that night?
KI-JUNG
No. I went straight home.
YON-KYO
Good, good.
(relieved)
That’s good to hear.
KI-JUNG
Such a nice man. I asked him to 
drop me off at Hyehwa Station, but 
he kept insisting that he would 
take me home. 
YON-KYO
(raising her voice)
So the bastard went to your house? 
At night? He knows where you 
live? 
KI-JUNG
No. I just got off at Hyehwa. 
38. YON-KYO
(sighs)
Thank God. You did the right 
thing. 
(English)
Nice, Jessica.
KI-JUNG
Did something happen to him?
Yon-Kyo opens the gate.
YON-KYO
He, well-- He won’t be working 
for us anymore. There was a bit 
of an incident. You don’t need to 
know the details.
KI-JUNG
That’s too bad. He seemed like a 
nice man.
YON-KYO
You’re so precious, Ms. Jessica. 
So innocent. You still have a lot 
to learn about this world. 
Ki-Jung stifles her laughter as she walks down the steps. She 
sees Mun-Kwang walking back home with the Parks’ THREE DOGS in 
the distance. 
Yon-Kyo waves at them. 
YON-KYO (CONT’D)
(sighs)
We used to like him too. We were 
excited to have a driver who was 
young and hip. 
KI-JUNG
I thought most people preferred 
older drivers.
YON-KYO
Yes, it’s true. Older drivers 
tend to drive more carefully. 
They’re more sophisticated. 
KI-JUNG
My uncle had a driver who was like 
that. Mr. Kim. A real gentleman. 
Such a kind man. We used to 
follow him like an uncle. 
YON-KYO
Really?
39. 28 28
KI-JUNG
Yes. He was such a warm and 
kindhearted person. 
Unfortunately, my uncle was 
transferred to Chicago and had to 
let Mr. Kim go. I don’t know what 
he’s doing these days-- 
YON-KYO
I’m very interested in this 
person, Ms. Jessica. Do you think 
I could meet him? As you can see, 
it’s becoming harder and harder 
for me to trust people. I won’t 
hire anyone unless they’re 
recommended by people I 
absolutely, positively trust. I 
just have a feeling he could be a 
great candidate since you grew up 
with him and all. 
Mun-Kwang walks within earshot and hears the conversation. Her 
curiosity is piqued. 
The dogs wag their tails and swarm Yon-Kyo. 
KI-JUNG
Would you like to meet him?
(English)
Are you serious?
YON-KYO
(English)
I am deadly serious. 
(Korean)
I think this is the best way to 
hire people. Through people I 
trust. It’s like a, what should I 
call it-- 
Yon-Kyo makes a peculiar hand gesture.
YON-KYO (CONT’D)
‘Belt of Trust.’
As the scene’s THEME MUSIC (titled “The Belt of Trust”) begins 
to play, we cut to the inside of a -- 
INT. MERCEDES 
Ki-Tek is in the driver seat. We don’t know whose car this is 
or where we are. He tries buckling the seat belt. Presses 
various buttons on the instrument panel. 
40. 29 29
30 30
Ki-Woo is in the backseat, telling his father to try this and 
that. When some people approach, the pair hop out of the car 
and move onto another one, revealing that --
We are inside a large MERCEDES DEALERSHIP in the middle of 
Gangnam. 
Ki-Tek and Ki-Woo continue to explore brand new Benzes, sharing 
quality father and son time. 
INT. DONG-IK’S COMPANY - CEO OFFICE - DAY 
An office overlooking Seoul’s soaring skyscrapers. Dong-Ik is 
in a meeting with his HOD’s. He suddenly looks up at the other 
side of the glass wall where -- 
Ki-Tek is sitting in a chair, waiting patiently to be seen. 
DONG-IK
(mouthing)
Sorry. I’ll. Be. Right. With. You. 
KI-TEK
Don’t worry, sir.
(mouthing & gesturing)
Take. Your. Time.
INT. DONG-IK’S CAR - DRIVING - LATE AFTERNOON 
DONG-IK
This isn’t a test or anything so 
you don’t have to be nervous. I 
just wanted to get out of the 
office. I was dying in there.
Ki-Tek is in the driver seat.
(”The Belt of Trust” continues under the scene.) 
KI-TEK
I understand. You’re surrounded 
by people all day. I’m sure you 
want some peace in the car. 
Ki-Tek turns off the car’s navigation.
DONG-IK
Thank you. You must know your way 
around the city.
KI-TEK
Every highway, road, and alley 
south of the DMZ. When you do 
this for 30 years, it becomes 
second nature.
41. 31 31
DONG-IK
I admire people who work in one 
profession their whole lives.
KI-TEK
It’s a simple job really. But I 
take pride in it. Every morning, 
I go on a journey. With a father, 
a CEO, or just a solitary man 
walking through life. It’s a sort 
of companionship--
DONG-IK
Ah.
KI-TEK
That’s how I’ve treated my job for 
the past 30 years. How time 
flies. 
The words drip with cheese, but somehow they sound heartfelt 
when Ki-Tek says it with his humble stammer. 
As the MUSIC crests toward a climax --
Ki-Tek turns the wheel, making a smooth left turn.
DONG-IK
Exquisite corner-work. I can feel 
your experience. 
INT. MANSION - STAIRS - NIGHT 
As MUSIC continues -- 
SLOW MOTION of Ki-Jung gracefully, rhythmically walking down 
the stairs. She finds -- 
Mun-Kwang dozing off at the dining table. Lightly snoring. 
Dogs circling her feet. 
Ki-Jung stares for a long moment. As she walks past the dining 
room -- 
She SLAPS the wall loudly, shocking Mun-Kwang out of her 
daydream. Mun-Kwang acts like she wasn’t sleeping. 
KI-JUNG (V.O.)
She’s an old fox. She acts like 
she’s Mrs. Park’s sister.
42. 32 32
33 33
INT. MANSION - DA-HAE’S ROOM - NIGHT 
Mun-Kwang leaves a plate of fruits for Ki-Woo and Da-Hae. 
Ki-Woo stares at her intently as she walks out. 
KI-WOO (V.O.)
She’s been in the house the 
longest. Longer than the family. 
She used to work for the previous 
owner, the architect Namgoong 
Hyunja, who recommended her to the 
Parks when he moved to France. 
Told them she takes great care of 
the house and so on-- 
INT. PIZZA TIME - DAY 
CHUNG-SOOK
So she survived an ownership 
change. 
KI-WOO
(nods)
It’s a made job. Of course she 
won’t just let go.
KI-JUNG
If we want to extract her, we’ll 
need to do some prep work.
KI-WOO
That’s right. We need a plan. 
Chung-Sook, Ki-Woo, and Ki-Jung are sitting at the corner 
table. We notice the tacky Pizza Time logo everywhere. 
The Pizza Shop Owner (from Scene 4) begrudgingly brings a 
combination pizza over to the table. She hates that she has to 
serve these losers. 
CHUNG-SOOK
Hey, how about some more hot sauce 
here? 
The Owner picks up a hot sauce from the other table and drops 
it in front of Chung-Sook. 
Chung-Sook mouths ‘bitch’ as the Owner walks away. 
Ki-Woo studies the hot sauce. He picks it up and squirts two 
drops on a blank napkin, as if testing something.
43. 34 34
35 35
36 36
37 37
KI-WOO
There’s something that Da-Hae told 
me.
INT. MANSION - DA-HAE’S ROOM - NIGHT 
DA-HAE
I’m so sick of apples. I want 
peaches. 
KI-WOO
Then why don’t you just ask for 
them?
Da-Hae is griping about the fruit plate Mun-Kwang brought. She 
picks up an apple slice and lovingly feeds it to Ki-Woo. 
DA-HAE
(pouting)
We can’t have peaches. It’s a 
forbidden fruit in our house. 
INT. NEIGHBORHOOD STORE - DAY 
Ki-Jung picks up a PEACH from the fruit section. She holds it 
in the sunlight and carefully examines the soft fuzz 
surrounding it. 
KI-WOO (V.O.)
The housekeeper has a severe peach 
allergy. If she even goes near a 
peach, she’ll turn red and start 
hyperventilating. Full-on asthma 
attack. Does everything but kill 
her. 
INT. SEMI-BASEMENT - KITCHEN - DAY 
Using a sharp razor, Ki-Woo meticulously shaves off the fuzz 
around the peach. He deposits the fuzz in a transparent pen 
cap.
HAUNTING, NERVE-SCRAPING MUSIC plays underneath. 
EXT. MANSION - GARDEN - LATE AFTERNOON 
Ki-Woo walks out of the house after another lesson. He bows to 
Mun-Kwang, who is in the yard handing out treats to the dogs. 
Ki-Woo takes out his pen as he passes Mun-Kwang. He opens the 
cap and gently pours peach fuzz over her shoulders. 
44. 38 38
39 39
40 40
EXT. MANSION - ROAD - NIGHT 
Ki-Woo has just walked out of the gate when he hears VIOLENT 
COUGHING from inside. It’s Mun-Kwang. 
He casually walks down the hill as the coughing echoes 
throughout the neighborhood, creating a discordant harmony with 
the MUSIC. 
INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - DAY 
Mun-Kwang is on the bench talking on her phone. Still covered 
in red spots. She’s unaware that -- 
Ki-Tek is watching her from several feet away. He takes out 
his phone and snaps a selfie, making sure to include Mun-Kwang 
in the background. 
MUN-KWANG
(into her phone)
It was the worst one I ever had. 
I was sure I was going to die. 
No. I’m telling you. No peaches 
for miles. That’s what I’m 
saying. It’s driving me nuts! 
INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - UNDERGROUND GARAGE - DAY 
Yon-Kyo carries a bunch of shopping bags out of the department 
store. 
Ki-Tek is waiting at the Mercedes. He opens the trunk and puts 
Yon-Kyo’s bags in. When he’s done, he continues to linger. He 
hesitates before taking out his phone. 
KI-TEK
Mrs. Park. I, um, I didn’t know 
if this was worth mentioning, but 
I wanted to make sure.
He shows Yon-Kyo a photo on his phone. 
KI-TEK (CONT’D)
This person behind me. Is that-- 
YON-KYO
What-- Hey, that’s Mun-Kwang!
KI-TEK
So it was her. I didn’t quite 
remember her face. I’d only seen 
her a couple of times when I went 
up to the house. 
45. 41 41
42 42
YON-KYO
Where is this from? Is that a 
hospital? 
KI-TEK
Yes. I was at the hospital the 
other day for an annual check-up. 
I was taking a selfie to send my 
wife when I saw her behind me. 
Yon-Kyo looks closely at the picture.
YON-KYO
Looks like she’s talking on the 
phone.
KI-TEK
Yes, see-- I didn’t mean to, but 
I ended up overhearing--
INT. SEMI-BASEMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY (FLASHBACK) 
KI-TEK
(stammering)
I, uh, didn’t mean to eavesdrop, 
but I happened to be right there, 
and unfortunately, uh, overheard 
everything-- 
KI-WOO
Cut, stop right there. Dad, 
you’re overdoing it. The worrying 
thing. Tone it down. I can tell 
you’re acting.
Ki-Tek rehearses his ‘scene,’ holding a piece of paper with his 
lines. 
KI-WOO (CONT’D)
Action!
INT. MERCEDES - DRIVING - DAY 
KI-TEK
I really didn’t mean to. I was 
right there, and I just happened 
to overhear. 
YON-KYO
(interested)
What did you hear?
46. 43 43
44 44
45 45
46 46
Ki-Tek looks at Yon-Kyo through the rearview mirror. He takes 
a hesitant beat before opening his mouth. 
KI-TEK
I don’t know if I should say-- 
INT. SEMI-BASEMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY (FLASHBACK) 
KI-WOO
(acting)
I heard her say that she was -- 
diagnosed with tuberculosis!
INT. MERCEDES - DRIVING - DAY 
YON-KYO
(stunned)
Tuberculosis! Are you sure?
KI-TEK
What was it-- “Active pulmonary 
tuberculosis.” She was talking on 
the phone, and she seemed very 
upset. Like she was angry at 
herself. 
INT. SEMI-BASEMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY (FLASHBACK) 
KI-WOO
(female voice)
I didn’t even know tuberculosis 
was still a thing. 
INT. MERCEDES - DRIVING - DAY 
YON-KYO
I didn’t even know tuberculosis 
was still a thing. 
KI-TEK
Neither did I. I remember years 
ago we used to buy those seals for 
Christmas, but I thought it was 
all over. You should look it up. 
Korea still has the highest 
tuberculosis rate among OECD 
countries. 
YON-KYO
I can’t believe that Mun-Kwang-- 
(emotional)
How could she not tell me? I 
can’t-- 
47. 47 47
48 48
49 49
KI-TEK
I wasn’t sure if I should say 
anything, but I felt like you 
should know. I mean, she was just 
going about her business like 
everything was normal. There are 
young children in the house. DaSong is only ten. And this woman, 
with her tuberculosis, is in the 
kitchen making food and touching 
the dishes--
YON-KYO
Stop! 
Yon-Kyo goes into a shrieking fit. 
YON-KYO (CONT’D)
Please! No more!
INT. MANSION - DA-SONG’S ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON 
The art lesson is in progress. Ki-Jung has Da-Song in her lap. 
She touches Da-Song’s face with her cheek as she looks at his 
drawing.
Ki-Jung’s cell phone DINGS. It’s a text from Ki-Tek -- 
“ETA 3 min. Get ready.”
INT. MANSION - STAIRS - LATE AFTERNOON 
SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC builds as Ki-Jung descends the stairs. When 
she removes her hand from her pocket, we see that it’s covered 
in soft PEACH FUZZ. The fuzz glistens in the afternoon 
sunlight as Ki-Jung walks down to the --
KITCHEN
Where she opens the fridge and removes a bottle of water. 
Mun-Kwang comes over and hands her a glass. As Ki-Jung takes 
the glass, she casually wipes the peach fuzz on Mun-Kwang’s 
hand. 
INT. MANSION - GARAGE - LATE AFTERNOON 
Our first time inside the garage. Ki-Tek carries the many 
shopping bags up the stairs. Yon-Kyo follows when -- 
She hears VIOLENT COUGHING coming from upstairs. 
48. 50 50
51 51
52 52
INT. MANSION - ENTRANCE - LATE AFTERNOON 
Yon-Kyo is appalled to see --
Mun-Kwang coughing like a sick dog as she comes out to greet 
her and Ki-Tek. Mun-Kwang tries to take the bags from Ki-Tek, 
but the coughing becomes unbearable, and she runs to the --
KITCHEN
She tries to stifle her cough with a napkin. No use. She 
throws the napkin in the trash and rushes to the bathroom. 
Yon-Kyo is horrified. It’s like watching Ebola spread in front 
of her eyes. 
Ki-Tek just stands there, staring quietly at the discarded 
napkin in the kitchen. 
INT. SEMI-BASEMENT - LIVING ROOM - EVENING (FLASHBACK) 
KI-WOO
If you find an opportunity -- do 
it. Just like we practiced. 
It’ll be the cherry on top. 
INT. MANSION - ENTRANCE - LATE AFTERNOON 
Ki-Tek leaves Yon-Kyo behind and walks over to the kitchen. He 
removes his hand from his pocket and reaches into the trash 
can, at which point we cut to --
A PIZZA TIME HOT SAUCE PACKET hidden in Ki-Tek’s palm. 
Ki-Tek quickly squirts the red sauce on the napkin. 
KI-WOO (V.O.)
Our bloody finale. 
A terrified Yon-Kyo watches as Ki-Tek removes the ‘bloody’ 
napkin from the trash. Ki-Tek grimly holds it up in front of 
her. 
Yon-Kyo becomes dizzy. She closes her eyes to keep herself 
from fainting. 
The MUSIC that continued through the last several scenes -- 
“The Belt of Trust” -- comes to a dramatic end. 
49. 53 53
54 54
INT. MANSION - STAIRS - LATE AFTERNOON 
No more music. The house is quiet. 
We see a text from Yon-Kyo on Ki-Tek’s phone -- 
“2nd floor sauna. Make sure she doesn’t see you.“
Ki-Tek looks around before quietly treading up the stairs. 
INT. MANSION - SAUNA - LATE AFTERNOON 
A small, phone-booth-sized sauna situated at the end of the 
hallway between the dressing room and bathroom. 
As soon as Ki-Tek walks in, Yon-Kyo shuts the door and pulls 
down the roller shades. They are now inches away from each 
other in the tight space. Light seeps in from outside, 
illuminating Yon-Kyo’s bloodshot eyes and smeared makeup. 
YON-KYO
Mr. Kim, you have to promise you 
won’t tell my husband. 
KI-TEK
Of course.
YON-KYO
He can’t find out that I’ve been 
keeping that walking lung disease 
around the kids this whole time. 
He’ll kill me. 
KI-TEK
Don’t worry, Mrs. Park. 
(then)
I don’t want to step out of line, 
but I had a request as well. See, 
I have nothing personal against 
the housekeeper. 
(whispering)
I only acted out of a moral 
obligation to protect the health 
and safety of the public. I 
wouldn’t want Mr. Park to think 
that I’m some kind of tattletale--
YON-KYO
(cutting him off)
Don’t worry. I’m not even going 
to mention the tuberculosis to 
Mun-Kwang. I’ll come up with a 
completely unrelated reason. Let 
her go quietly. 
50. 55 55
56 56
57 57
KI-TEK
I see. 
YON-KYO
(sighs)
It’s the best way. I’ve done it 
before.
KI-TEK
Well, I trust your judgment. 
Ki-Tek puts out his hand, as if he wants to officialize their 
top-secret deal. 
They are sharing the most awkward handshake in the world when 
Yon-Kyo suddenly cringes. 
YON-KYO
Did you wash your hands, Mr. Kim?
INT. MANSION - KITCHEN / BACKYARD - LATE EVENING 
The backyard seen through kitchen windows. Strong winds shake 
the trees. A storm is on route. 
Yon-Kyo is seated at the patio table with Mun-Kwang. Her face 
is cold as she calmly explains something to her soon-to-be 
former housekeeper. 
Mun-Kwang’s face gradually turns dark. 
EXT. MANSION - ROAD - LATE EVENING 
Mun-Kwang carries a large bag down the hill. Still in 
disbelief. Devastated. Her hair dances wildly in the rough 
wind. The sky is getting darker. 
Mun-Kwang keeps looking back at the house as she walks away. 
She stops and stares at the firmly closed gate for a long time. 
INT. MERCEDES - DRIVING - NIGHT 
It’s raining outside. 
DONG-IK
Mr. Kim, do you know a place where 
I can get some good short ribs? 
Somewhere not too far.
KI-TEK
Of course.
51. Ki-Tek turns the wheel and switches lanes.
KI-TEK (CONT’D)
You’ll be eating out tonight? 
DONG-IK
Yes. I suddenly had a craving for 
juicy short ribs. Since I can’t 
have them at home now. 
Ki-Tek makes an effortless U-turn across the large, eight-lane 
road. The raindrops on the window swerve diagonally.
DONG-IK (CONT’D)
(smiles)
Our housekeeper used to make the 
best short ribs. 
KI-TEK
You mean the lady who just quit 
yesterday? 
DONG-IK
She was with us for a long time. 
I don’t know why she suddenly 
left. Mrs. Park wouldn’t even 
tell me. I mean, there’s no 
shortage of housekeepers looking 
for work so I guess we can just 
hire another one. But it’s a real 
pity. She was a great lady. 
KI-TEK
I see. 
DONG-IK
She took care of all the little 
things in the house. And she was 
a tremendous cook. Most 
importantly, she never crossed the 
line. If there’s one thing I 
hate, it’s people who cross the 
line. Well, I guess she did have 
one flaw. 
(laughs)
She was a big eater. Ate twice as 
much as other people. But I 
suppose she worked twice as hard 
to make up for that. 
KI-TEK
I guess Mrs. Park will need to 
find a new housekeeper soon. 
52. DONG-IK
(nods)
Or the house will descend into 
chaos. I guarantee she won’t be 
able to survive a week without 
one. Shambles, I tell you. My 
clothes will start smelling--
(laughs)
Mrs. Park definitely wins the 
worst homemaker award. Doesn’t 
know her way around a vacuum, and 
her cooking is just -- abysmal! 
KI-TEK
But... you still love her, don’t 
you?
Ki-Tek’s suddenly serious comment catches Dong-Ik off guard. 
Silence. Then Dong-Ik starts laughing. Hard. 
DONG-IK
Of course I love her! I don’t 
know what else you’d call this. 
KI-TEK
Then maybe you should look at 
this-- 
Ki-Tek removes a business card from his pocket and hands it to 
Dong-Ik.
On beautiful ivory-colored stock, only the name, “The Care,” is 
printed in elegant typography. No number. No address. 
DONG-IK
The Care? What is this?
KI-TEK
I just found out about them 
recently too. It’s a membershipbased total care company. 
Catering to families of VIP’s like 
yourself. They provide maids, inhome caregivers, also drivers like 
myself. From what I hear, they 
select only the best. The most 
experienced workers. 
DONG-IK
Looks very nice.
Dong-Ik flips the card to the other side. 
DONG-IK (CONT’D)
The design is gorgeous. How did 
you learn about this company, Mr. 
Kim?
53. 58 58
KI-TEK
They called me about working for 
them. I guess I’m one of the more 
experienced drivers around, so 
they wanted to recruit me. I 
turned them down because I was 
already scheduled to meet you. 
DONG-IK
I see.
(nods)
Well, I’m honored that you chose 
me over such a reputable company. 
I am forever grateful, Mr. Kim! 
Dong-Ik laughs. 
KI-TEK
(laughs)
You’re being ridiculous, sir. 
They’re laughing, but there’s a subtle underlying tension 
between the two men. There’s still a ‘line’ that Dong-Ik won’t 
cross. He suddenly drops his smile. 
DONG-IK
Well, then. I guess I’ll just 
give this to Mrs. Park. 
KI-TEK
Yes, you should. But don’t say I 
gave it to you. 
(smiles)
You should tell her that you 
looked it up yourself. 
DONG-IK
(laughs)
Good idea! That’s sure to earn me 
some points. Thank you, Mr. Kim.
KI-TEK
They’re membership-only, so I 
don’t think they have a website or 
anything. There’s a consultation 
number in the back-- 
INT. SEMI-BASEMENT - MORNING 
RING RING RING. Ki-Jung picks up an OLD FLIP PHONE with “The 
Care” business card taped on front. 
She sounds like a completely different person. Sweet. 
Welcoming. 
54. 59 59
60 60
KI-JUNG
(into the phone)
Thank you for calling The Care. 
This is senior advisor Yeo MyungSun. How may I help you? 
Chung-Sook and Ki-Tek watch Ki-Jung as they eat breakfast. 
CHUNG-SOOK
She could have won an Oscar if she 
became an actress. 
KI-TEK
She has a nice voice, doesn’t she? 
Just like me. 
INT. MANSION - KITCHEN - MORNING 
Yon-Kyo has the phone on speaker. She has disposable kitchen 
gloves on and is generally floundering in the kitchen, 
overloading the dishwasher and sterilizing the ‘disease-ridden’ 
pots and pans in an oversized steamer. 
YON-KYO
(into the phone)
I heard I need to sign up for a 
membership.
KI-JUNG (PHONE)
That’s correct. We are a 
membership-only service. If you 
aren’t currently a member I can 
guide you through the steps to 
become one.
YON-KYO
(into the phone)
Sure, okay. 
KI-JUNG (PHONE)
Do you have a pen? I can give you 
the list of forms you need to 
submit. 
EXT. MANSION - BACKYARD - LATE AFTERNOON 
A fully transformed Chung-Sook sits at the white patio table 
with Yon-Kyo. Classy hairstyle. Tasteful makeup. 
Yon-Kyo goes through Chung-Sook’s papers, especially focusing 
on her doctor’s note. 
55. 61 61
Just then a WHITE BUTTERFLY flits by Chung-Sook’s face, its 
wings playfully bouncing off the bright summer light.
Over the idyllic scene, a beautiful ARIA begins to flow-- 
INT. MANSION - VARIOUS - EVENING 
As MUSIC continues -- 
STEADICAM SHOT -- We glide up the stairs, first following 
Chung-Sook’s feet then rising up to shoulder height, tracking 
her from behind as she walks down the second floor hallway. 
She opens the door to --
DA-HAE’S ROOM 
We follow Chung-Sook as she walks in and sets down a plate of 
fruits in front of Da-Hae and Ki-Woo. 
DA-HAE
Yay! Peaches! 
CHUNG-SOOK
Please have some too, Mr. Kevin.
KI-WOO
Thank you, ma’am. 
Chung-Sook pinches Ki-Woo’s earlobe while Da-Hae is not 
looking. Ki-Woo nearly jumps. Chung-Sook just smiles and 
walks out of the room. We continue to follow her as she pads 
down the hall and enters --
DA-SONG’S ROOM
Where we see the TEEPEE in the corner. The flap opens and KiJung peeks out to see who it is. Da-Song is tightly cuddled up 
between her arms drawing a picture. He looks at Chung-Sook, 
embarrassed.
KI-JUNG
Next time just knock and leave the 
food outside. 
CHUNG-SOOK
Sorry--
KI-JUNG
Please don’t come in during the 
lesson.
Chung-Sook scoffs. She mouths ‘JUST EAT THE DAMN PEACHES’ as 
she hands over the plate. She looks around at the drawings in 
the room. Not impressed. She steps out into the -- 
56. HALLWAY
We hear DONG-IK arriving downstairs. Da-Song hears it too. He 
bolts out of the room and flies past Chung-Sook toward the --
DINING ROOM
DA-SONG
Daddy! Did you get the walkie?
YON-KYO
Da-Song! Lesson’s not over yet!
DONG-IK
This guy. That’s all you think 
about, isn’t it? Camping. 
Dong-Ik picks up Da-Song and holds him tightly. 
CAMERA CIRCLES AROUND THEM and shows --
Ki-Tek emerging from the garage with a bunch of boxes. Brand 
new camping supplies. On top is a WALKIE-TALKIE box.
DA-SONG
Wow! T-667! Dope!
YON-KYO
What’s all this stuff? We just 
bought camping gear last year. 
DONG-IK
These are different. Might as 
well complete the collection. 
Da-Song has already opened the walkie-talkie box. He also goes 
through the other items -- CAMPFIRE SUPPLIES, AN AXE FOR 
CHOPPING FIREWOOD...
As Ki-Tek walks out, he quickly feels up Chung-Sook’s behind. 
Chung-Sook giggles to herself as she goes to the kitchen sink. 
The long STEADICAM SHOT is about to come to a glorious end 
after showing the semi-basement’s family complete and 
successful infiltration of the Park mansion. Wait. Not yet-- 
Da-Song suddenly starts sniffing the air. He runs over to 
Chung-Sook and shoves his nose in her belly, startling her 
greatly. 
Da-Song then darts over to Ki-Tek and shoves his nose in his 
pant leg. 
YON-KYO
Da-Song! What’s wrong with you?
57. 62 62
DA-SONG
Same smell. They smell exactly 
the same!
Ki-Tek and Chung-Sook freeze. 
Yon-Kyo, embarrassed, roughly pushes Da-Song away. 
YON-KYO
Stop talking nonsense and go up to 
your room. Ms. Jessica is 
waiting. 
DA-SONG
That’s weird. Ms. Jessica has the 
same smell.
Dong-Ik laughs awkwardly. 
DONG-IK
(to Ki-Tek)
He’s a little out there. 
They all laugh, but no one is laughing inside. 
INT. SEMI-BASEMENT - NIGHT 
The table teems with food. We notice the viewing stone 
displayed prominently in the middle. An interesting decorating 
choice. 
Ki-Tek is cooking ribs and mushrooms on an electric skillet 
when he suddenly smells his clothes. 
KI-TEK
He scared me, the little punk. 
Does this mean we all have to use 
different soaps? 
KI-WOO
Maybe we should all wash our 
clothes with different detergent. 
Different fabric softeners too.
CHUNG-SOOK
You mean I have to wash all of 
your clothes separately? Fuck no. 
KI-JUNG
(expressionless)
It won’t work. It’s the basement 
smell.
Ki-Woo is blank.
58. KI-JUNG (CONT’D)
The smell won’t go away unless we 
leave this place.
Truth bomb. They all fall silent at the brutal reality check, 
and for a while we only hear the sizzling of the grill. 
Ki-Tek picks up his Sapporo and tries to change the subject. 
KI-TEK
Forget about that. This is a good 
problem to have. Think about our 
lives before. It’s a dog-eat-dog 
world out there. Hundreds of 
college graduates compete for a 
security guard job for Chrissake. 
(emotional)
Not us. We are all gainfully 
employed. 
KI-WOO
You’re right, Father. Cheers!
KI-TEK
Sure we may not be getting sixfigure salaries, but it’s no small 
amount if you combine our wages. 
The Parks are investing a great 
part of their fortune in our 
family. So let us give thanks to 
Mr. Park, our generous employer. 
A great man. And how can I forget 
Min-Hyuk! How lucky that our son 
is friends with such a thoughtful 
young man. It’s all because of 
him that-- FUCK! Do they always 
have to ruin the moment?
The family members all turn toward --
The window, which is being rattled by a robust stream of urine. 
A SHORT, BARELY STANDING DRUNK MAN is relieving himself in the 
corner. 
KI-WOO
That mother--
Ki-woo jumps up. He grabs the viewing stone from the table and 
walks toward the door. 
Ki-Tek, worried, quickly runs after him. 
KI-JUNG
(scoffs)
Oh, no. Here comes the rage 
machine.
59. 63 63
64 64
CHUNG-SOOK
Why’s he acting tough all of a 
sudden? Is he trying to kill 
someone? 
Ki-Tek catches up to Ki-Woo and wrests the stone from his 
hands. 
Ki-Woo picks up an umbrella instead. He runs out. 
Ki-Jung lights up. This is going to be fun. She opens the 
HIGH-SPEED PHOTOGRAPHY APP on her phone and starts filming. We 
see the following sequence through the app, in slow motion -- 
Ki-Woo appears outside the window and starts swinging the 
umbrella wildly at the Short Man, who sprays urine everywhere 
as he falls. 
Ki-Tek runs out with a bucket of water. He throws the water at 
the Short Man but momentarily loses balance and splashes Ki-Woo 
instead. 
Ki-Jung laughs. This is gold. 
Chung-Sook has no interest. She continues grilling meat, happy 
to finish the food by herself. 
UNSETTLING MUSIC plays over the wild, primal thrashing of the 
three men. The violent, rage-fueled dance DISSOLVES TO -- 
EXT. MANSION - GARDEN - DAY 
The garden is sun-drenched. Da-Song looks up at the sky 
through a piece of soot-covered glass, an improvised sunviewer. He has a bow and axe strapped to his back. 
He pushes the button on his walkie-talkie. 
DA-SONG
(into the radio)
The sky is mostly clear. Some 
clouds visible, but no rain 
clouds. Over. 
INT. MANSION - DINING ROOM 
DONG-IK
(into the radio)
Copy that. I’m here in the 
kitchen, and Da-Hae has been 
infected with a serious case of 
‘duck lips.’ If she keeps pouting 
like that she might actually turn 
into a duck! She looks pissed, 
over. 
60. 65 65
Dong-Ik giggles as he teases Da-Hae, who looks completely 
miserable in her camping outfit. 
YON-KYO
What’s with the face? Let’s all 
try to have a good time. 
DA-HAE
Can’t I just stay home and study 
with Kevin? 
YON-KYO
I know you hate camping, but it’s 
Da-Song’s birthday. And you’re 
his sister. Come on. It won’t be 
so bad. We’ll build a fire. Sing 
happy birthday at midnight. Blow 
out candles under the stars. 
It’ll be wonderful. 
Chung-Sook brings up a tent bag and a guitar case from the 
storage basement. 
Da-Hae gives up and puts on her large bluetooth headphones, 
shutting out reality. 
Yon-Kyo takes Chung-Sook to the living room where the three 
dogs are. 
YON-KYO (CONT’D)
I’m sure you know all of their 
names by now. 
(from left to right)
Berry, Junie, Foofoo. 
CHUNG-SOOK
Of course. Berry and Junie only 
eat Natural Balance Organic. 
Yon-Kyo emphasizes by pointing at each of the dog’s foods in 
the care basket.
YON-KYO
Yes. And Foofoo also needs this 
-- Kamaboko. Japanese crab cake.
INT. MANSION - GARAGE - DAY 
YON-KYO
And don’t hold the leash too short 
when you’re walking Junie. He 
needs to burn off that energy. 
It’s easy if you think of him as 
the canine version of Da-Song.
61. 66 66
CHUNG-SOOK
Don’t worry!
Yon-Kyo is sitting in the driver seat, endlessly rattling off 
instructions until --
The garage door goes all the way up, and the Mercedes starts 
rolling out. 
Da-Song pretends to shoot an arrow from the backseat, and 
Chung-Sook grabs her chest like she was shot. 
Moments later she’s finally alone. She presses the button. 
Her face gradually immerses in darkness as the shutter goes 
down. 
INT. MANSION - LIVING ROOM - EVENING 
Chung-Sook is taking a peaceful nap on the large sofa. We hear 
her soft breathing. Slanted late afternoon rays wrap her face 
warmly. 
She slowly wakes up and wipes her drool. When she sits up, we 
see Ki-Tek sleeping behind her. Chung-Sook looks out at the 
garden where -- 
Ki-Woo is lying in the grass with the three dogs. Looking at 
the sky. We notice a YELLOW JOURNAL clutched in his hand. 
CHUNG-SOOK
What are you doing out there? 
Come inside. 
Ki-Woo takes a deep breath as he gazes up at the sky. He’s 
never been more relaxed. 
KI-WOO
You should try it. It’s nice to 
be able to see the sky from your 
own home. 
He picks himself up and walks into the living room. He 
stretches his arms as he walks over to the kitchen. 
KI-WOO (CONT’D)
Water, Mom?
CHUNG-SOOK
Sure. 
Ki-Woo gets a few bottles of Evian from the fridge. He gives 
one to Chung-Sook before heading up the stairs. 
62. 67 67
68 68
69 69
70 70
A groggy Ki-Tek gets up from the sofa and trudges over to a 
cabinet in the corner. A variety of whiskeys are on display. 
INT. MANSION - 2ND FLOOR BATHROOM - EVENING 
Ki-Jung is taking a bubble bath. She picks up the remote and 
changes the channel on the wall-mounted TV when --
A KNOCK. 
KI-WOO (O.S.)
You want a water?
KI-JUNG
Read my mind. Thanks, brodie. 
The door opens a crack, and Ki-Woo rolls a bottle toward KiJung. He then continues on to -- 
INT. MANSION - DA-HAE’S ROOM - EVENING 
Ki-Woo throws himself on Da-Hae’s bed. He reaches into the 
space between the bed and the wall and finds a PRETTY WOODEN 
BOX hidden there. Da-Hae’s box of secrets. It has a small 
combination lock on the front. 
Ki-Woo unlocks the box and puts in the yellow journal he was 
reading. He then takes out ANOTHER YELLOW JOURNAL and opens 
it.
Pages filled with Da-Hae’s small, thoughtful handwriting. 
INT. MANSION - SAUNA - EVENING 
Ki-Tek sits with a white towel across his lap, sweating it out 
in the steam-filled room. He guzzles down a cold bottle of 
Evian. Refreshing. He turns the HOURGLASS upside down. 
The sound of myriad sand grains rolling down the glass turns 
into -- THE SOUND OF RAIN. 
INT. MANSION - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
The large coffee table is filled with various whiskey bottles 
and gourmet snacks. The four family members are comfortably 
sprawled across the couch and floor. It’s like they own the 
place. 
They sip whiskey and watch rain falling outside the window. 
63. KI-TEK
This is classy. Sipping whiskey 
on a rainy day. Enjoying the 
view. 
Ki-Tek takes several bottles and pours a little of each into 
his tumbler. 
CHUNG-SOOK
What the hell are you doing? Why 
are you mixing all the booze? 
KI-TEK
This way Mr. Park won’t notice. 
It’ll be too obvious if we drink 
from only one bottle. 
CHUNG-SOOK
Nice to see you use that brain for 
once. 
Berry comes over to Chung-Sook wagging her tail, but Chung-Sook 
kicks her away. Chung-Sook is already drunk. Her face is 
bright red. 
KI-JUNG
But you always get shitfaced when 
you mix your drinks, Dad. 
KI-TEK
(smiles)
Ki-Jung, that’s no way to talk to 
your father. “Shitfaced.” No. 
Not you too. 
KI-WOO
Let me pour you a shot, Father.
Ki-Woo tries to lighten the mood. He looks out the window as 
he pours a shot with both hands. 
KI-WOO (CONT’D)
It’s probably raining at the 
campsite too. They must be having 
a magical time. Da-Hae and her 
family. Raindrops pattering the 
tent. Playing the guitar... 
CHUNG-SOOK
By the way. What’s that yellow 
notebook you’ve been carrying?
KI-WOO
This?
64. Ki-Woo picks up the yellow journal. 
KI-WOO (CONT’D)
Da-Hae’s diary.
KI-JUNG
Oh, my God. Why are you reading 
that?
KI-WOO
I just want to understand her on a 
deeper level. 
KI-JUNG
Disgusting. You two going out or 
something? 
KI-WOO
(nods)
It’s serious. She likes me too. 
I’m going to officially ask her 
out when she goes to college. For 
real. 
They all stare at Ki-Woo. He must be shitting them. But he’s 
not. 
Ki-Tek slaps Ki-Woo’s shoulder.
KI-TEK
That’s my boy! That means this is 
your future wife’s house! The 
Parks will be your in-laws! 
KI-WOO
(laughs)
I guess that’s true. 
Chung-Sook joins the laughter.
CHUNG-SOOK
You mean I’m fucking washing 
dishes for my future in-laws? 
KI-TEK
Hilarious! You’re washing your 
future in-law’s tighty-whities! 
Your daughter-in-law’s school 
socks! 
Ki-Tek pretends to wash a sock, laughing hysterically, when he 
suddenly feels Chung-Sook’s murderous glare. He slowly stops. 
Chung-Sook downs her whiskey and turns serious. She calmly 
turns to Ki-Woo. 
65. CHUNG-SOOK
I like that girl. She’s nice. 
Pretty. But not full of herself. 
KI-WOO
Well, as long as we’re getting 
ahead of ourselves -- If you think 
about it, nowadays people barely 
see their in-laws anyway. How 
many times do you think families 
see each other after their kids 
get married?
KI-JUNG
(scoffs)
Crazy fuck. 
KI-WOO
You hear about people hiring 
actors to stand in for their 
parents at weddings. We’ll do the 
same thing. A lot of TV extras do 
that kind of work. 
Ki-Woo points at Ki-Jung.
KI-WOO (CONT’D)
She did too. Got paid to be one 
of the bride’s guests. She went 
to a bunch of weddings last year. 
KI-JUNG
I even caught a bouquet once. 
First time I ever saw the bitch. 
They pay ten bucks extra for the 
bouquet. 
CHUNG-SOOK
(laughs)
That’s how you became such a good 
actress!
Good times continue as whiskey flows. Jokes and laughter 
abound.
KI-TEK
Sure the acting was good, but I 
was surprised that the family was 
so easy to trick. 
CHUNG-SOOK
Especially the missus. Not the 
sharpest knife in the drawer. I 
guess we should be thankful for 
that-- 
66. KI-TEK
Yes, she’s so innocent. And kind. 
A rich person who’s also 
kindhearted. 
Chung-Sook stops mid-sip and stares at Ki-Tek. 
CHUNG-SOOK
Not “also kindhearted.” She’s 
kindhearted because she’s rich. 
You get it? 
Ki-Tek doesn’t. Chung-Sook looks around --
CHUNG-SOOK (CONT’D)
If I had all this, my heart would 
be overflowing with kindness! 
Chung-Sook’s voice grows. She gulps downs another glass. 
KI-TEK
That’s true. Your mother has a 
point. Rich people are more 
naive. They don’t have a bitter 
bone in them. And the kids are 
happier. No wiseasses. 
CHUNG-SOOK
It’s the money! Money cures all 
the little wiseasses!
Ki-Jung slowly grows irritated as her parents go on and on 
about rich people. She tosses back her whiskey. 
KI-TEK
Ki-Woo. That guy. What was his 
name? Yun? The old driver. 
KI-WOO
Yes. Mr. Yun.
KI-TEK
He’s probably doing fine, right? 
I’m sure he got a new job. 
KI-WOO
Of course. He’s young. Healthy. 
Plenty of opportunities.
KI-TEK
Yeah, I’m sure he got an even 
better job. 
Ki-Jung SLAMS down her glass and yells at her family -- 
67. KI-JUNG
SHUT THE FUCK UP!
KI-WOO
What the hell’s wrong with you?
KI-JUNG
Fuck rich people! Just worry 
about your own goddamn family! 
Ki-Jung looks like she’s about to cry. We’ve never seen her 
like this before. Vulnerable. Like a hurt child. 
KI-JUNG (CONT’D)
Dad, please. Stop worrying about 
other people. Look at me. Us. 
Your son and daughter. We’re 
right here! 
Almost at the exact moment as Ki-Jung’s soulful outburst, like 
a timed effect, LIGHTNING AND THUNDER strike outside the 
window. Followed by heavy rain. 
Ki-Tek looks out the window. 
KI-TEK
(laughing)
Did you see that! Right on cue!
KI-WOO
(imitating Ki-Jung)
“Dad, we’re right here!” POW! 
Thunder and lightning! Awesome. 
Ki-Woo tries to console Ki-Jung. He brushes her hair and talks 
in a brotherly voice. 
KI-WOO (CONT’D)
Come on now, Jessica. Let’s 
drink. Cheers!
Ki-Woo clinks his glass against Ki-Jung’s.
KI-WOO (CONT’D)
You know, Ki-Jung, when I saw you 
upstairs in the bathroom-- You 
looked so-- 
KI-JUNG
What? I looked so what?
KI-WOO
You just looked so natural in that 
bathtub. This house. It suits 
you. You’re not like us. 
68. KI-JUNG
(smiles)
Fuck off.
KI-WOO
(to Ki-Tek)
It’s true, Dad. She was in the 
tub watching TV, taking a fancy 
bubble bath, and it just felt like 
she belonged here. 
KI-TEK
Is that right?
Ki-Woo becomes more animated at Ki-Tek’s exaggerated reaction. 
He opens his arms wide and looks around at the living room. 
KI-WOO
Imagine for a second that this is 
our house. Let’s say we live 
here. Which room would you like 
to have? Out of all the beautiful 
rooms designed by the great 
Namgoong Hyunja, which one would 
you want to be yours?
KI-JUNG
I don’t know. Buy me the fucking 
house first and I’ll think about 
it. 
KI-TEK
We’re ‘living’ here right now, 
aren’t we? We’re here in the 
living room, drinking and having a 
good time, just like we would if 
this was our place.
KI-WOO
That’s true. We ARE currently 
living here. For all intents and 
purposes. 
KI-TEK
This IS our house right now.
(burps)
Nice and cozy.
Chung-Sook, face bulging red, flashes a dirty grin. 
CHUNG-SOOK
You’re cozy, huh? That’s real 
nice. What if Park comes back 
right now?
(to Ki-Jung)
He would skitter away like a 
little cockroach. 
69. Chung-Sook laughs loudly at her own joke. Ki-Tek is quiet.
CHUNG-SOOK (CONT’D)
(snickering)
You kids know what I’m talking 
about, right? Our apartment. How 
when we turn on the kitchen 
lights, the roaches all run away 
and disappear under the cabinets. 
He would be exactly like that! 
Ki-Tek stares hard at Chung-Sook, who continues to howl. KiTek’s eyes are red. Hostile. This is a different Ki-Tek. 
KI-TEK
(mumbling)
Fucking bitch. You’ve gone too 
far this time. 
Chung-Sook is silent. 
KI-TEK (CONT’D)
What? I’m a cockroach?
CRASH! Ki-Tek sweeps the table and knocks over the bottles and 
plates. 
Ki-Woo and Ki-Jung are stunned.
Chung-Sook is absolutely still. She glowers at Ki-Tek, who 
unlike before doesn’t back down. He stares right back, tension 
growing, when -- 
His face starts cracking. He begins to snicker. 
Chung-Sook does too. They both burst into laughter. 
KI-TEK (CONT’D)
I got you! I totally got you!
The two continue to laugh their asses off. Ki-Tek seems 
especially pleased with his performance. He slaps Ki-Woo on 
the shoulder. 
KI-TEK (CONT’D)
How was that, Spielberg? Pretty 
realistic right? You like my 
acting now? 
KI-WOO
Wow, Dad! You totally got me. 
Ki-Jung laughs, relieved.
70. KI-JUNG
(to Ki-Tek)
Shit. You’re going to clean this 
up, right?
CHUNG-SOOK
(laughing)
I didn’t believe him for one 
second. 
KI-WOO
Really? I thought he was really 
going to kill you. 
CHUNG-SOOK
He could never do that. Your 
father hasn’t a single backbone in 
his body. The epitome of a 
spineless mo-- 
They are all laughing uproariously when -- 
The DOORBELL rings loudly throughout the house. 
They all freeze and look at each other. Who the hell could 
that be? The doorbell continues to ring. 
KI-WOO
Who could it be at this time?
KI-TEK
What do you think it is?
Chung-Sook scurries over to the gate monitor. She sees --
A familiar round face filling the screen. It’s MUN-KWANG. 
She’s standing in the rain dressed in all black. 
CHUNG-SOOK
What the--
KI-WOO
Why is she here?
CHUNG-SOOK
It’s her, right? The old 
housekeeper.
KI-JUNG
(nods)
Why do you think she’s here?
Mun-Kwang presses the doorbell again and again. It rings 
loudly throughout the neighborhood. This could go on for a 
while. 
71. KI-TEK
What’s she doing? Why doesn’t she 
just leave?
KI-JUNG
It’s so loud. She could go on all 
night-- 
CHUNG-SOOK
(cutting her off)
Hold on. I’m supposed to be here. 
I can answer. 
Before Ki-Woo can stop her, Chung-Sook presses the ‘speak’ 
button. 
CHUNG-SOOK (CONT’D)
Who is it?
MUN-KWANG (SPEAKER)
Hi, how are you? I’m-- Mrs. Park 
isn’t in, right? 
Mun-Kwang’s speech is slightly slurred. She’s had a drink or 
two herself.
MUN-KWANG (SPEAKER) (CONT’D)
I used to work here. For ma--ny 
many years. The monitor you’re 
looking at. There’s a picture 
above it, right? Berry, Junie, 
Foofoo -- from left to right. 
CHUNG-SOOK
That’s all fine, but how can I 
help you? It’s very late.
MUN-KWANG (SPEAKER)
You’re my replacement, aren’t you! 
Mun-Kwang laughs. Sad, drunk laughter. Chung-Sook remains on 
guard.
Mun-Kwang suddenly turns serious. 
MUN-KWANG (SPEAKER) (CONT’D)
I’m so sorry to bother you at this 
hour. There’s something in the 
basement that I left behind, and I 
was wondering if I could pick it 
up. I was fired without any 
notice so I didn’t have time to 
gather all my things. 
72. 71 71
72 72
Chung-Sook looks at Ki-Woo. What do we do? Ki-Woo has no 
idea. 
KI-WOO
This wasn’t in our plan. 
INT. MANSION - ENTRANCE - NIGHT 
Chung-Sook opens the door to reveal Mun-Kwang standing in the 
rain. She looks grotesque with one eye heavily swollen. Her 
face is eerily and intermittently illuminated by the motionsensor light. 
INT. MANSION - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Mun-Kwang drips water as she walks over to the kitchen. The 
living room is not fully visible from her vantage point. 
Ki-Tek, Ki-Woo, and Ki-Jung remain in the dark around the 
coffee table, listening to Chung-Sook and Mun-Kwang’s 
conversation. 
MUN-KWANG
I’m sorry for the intrusion. 
Thank you so much for letting me 
in.
She looks over at the kitchen sink.
MUN-KWANG (CONT’D)
The faucet drips if you turn it 
that way.
Mun-Kwang continues to drone on deliriously. We don’t know if 
she’s just drunk or crazy. 
CHUNG-SOOK
The faucet’s fine. What do you 
need to pick up? 
MUN-KWANG
Would you like to come down with 
me?
Mun-Kwang flashes a creepy grin as she points to the stairs 
descending into the dark storage basement.
Chung-Sook is spooked. She hesitates. 
CHUNG-SOOK
No thanks. Just hurry up and get 
what you need. 
73. 73 73
74 74
INT. MANSION - KITCHEN - NIGHT 
CLOSE ON -- A DROP OF WATER precariously dangling from the 
kitchen faucet. 
It’s been a while since Mun-Kwang went down to the storage 
room. Chung-Sook starts getting worried. She gets up from the 
chair. 
INT. MANSION - STORAGE BASEMENT - NIGHT 
A nervous Chung-Sook walks down the narrow staircase and peers 
into the darkness. She hears a strange MOAN coming from inside 
and soon discovers -- 
Mun-Kwang levitating horizontally in the air! We realize that 
she actually has her feet set against the wall and is pushing 
the jar cabinet with her hands. The glass jars rattle as she 
shoves with all her might. 
Chung-Sook is confused.
MUN-KWANG
Can you give me a hand? Help me 
push!
CHUNG-SOOK
Huh? 
MUN-KWANG
(tearful)
He’s going to die! Please!
CHUNG-SOOK
What’s going on--
MUN-KWANG
Just help me first!
Chung-Sook has no idea what’s going on but starts pushing with 
Mun-Kwang. 
We see Ki-Woo, Ki-Jung, and Ki-Tek peeking from the staircase. 
Chung-Sook sees something on the ground as she’s pushing. 
CHUNG-SOOK
Wait. Maybe this is the problem. 
Chung-Sook pulls a bundle of wires stuck under the cabinet. As 
soon as she does -- 
74. 75 75
The cabinet smoothly rolls to the side pretty much on its own, 
as if it’s set on rails. It moves out of view to reveal, to 
Chung-Sook’s great astonishment -- 
A DARK STEEL DOOR hidden behind it. 
Mun-Kwang opens the door and hurries inside. 
Chung-Sook shakes off her shock and follows Mun-Kwang down the 
dark staircase. 
INT. MANSION - SECRET ROOM - NIGHT 
MUN-KWANG
Babe! Babe! 
We get glimpses of the dark underground bunker as Mun-Kwang 
waves around the flashlight on her cell phone -- low ceiling, 
gray walls, a small passageway... 
Chung-Sook covers her nose at the awful smell. 
MUN-KWANG (CONT’D)
Kun-Sae!
Mun-Kwang’s flashlight finally finds -- 
A PALE, SEVERELY MALNOURISHED FACE. This is KUN-SAE, 45, MunKwang’s husband. He looks up from his cot, woken up by the 
sound. He blinks his large eyes. 
Chung-Sook looks horrified. 
KUN-SAE
Stop yelling. I’m okay... 
Mun-Kwang immediately shoves a BABY BOTTLE in his mouth and 
starts feeding him. It’s filled with some kind of gruel. 
MUN-KWANG
No, you’re not. You’re not okay!
(weeping)
Why are you in the dark? Why did 
you turn off the lights?
KUN-SAE
We have to conserve energy. It 
all comes out of Mr. Park’s 
pocket. 
Kun-Sae turns on the light and is startled to see -- 
Chung-Sook standing in front of him. 
75. He springs from his bed, but Mun-Kwang pushes him back down. 
MUN-KWANG
It’s fine. We’re okay. 
Mun-Kwang points at Chung-Sook.
MUN-KWANG (CONT’D)
She’s a friend. She helped me get 
in here. It was the damn wires. 
They were stuck under the cabinet.
KUN-SAE
No wonder.
(laughs weakly)
I tried everything but I couldn’t 
get it to open. I couldn’t go up 
to the kitchen. 
MUN-KWANG
(sobbing)
How many days have you gone 
without food? I’m so sorry, babe! 
Chung-Sook is at a loss. 
Ki-Woo, Ki-Jung, and Ki-Tek have followed Chung-Sook and MunKwang down and are eavesdropping from the staircase. They look 
stunned. 
CHUNG-SOOK
What are you people up to? Why 
are you-- 
MUN-KWANG
I know how this looks. You must 
think we’re crazy. But please, 
Chung-Sook. Have some pity. Us 
domestic workers, we’re sisters-- 
CHUNG-SOOK
(surprised)
How the hell do you know my name? 
MUN-KWANG
Da-Song and I still text from time 
to time. I came here because I 
knew the family would be on a 
camping trip. I wanted to talk to 
you alone.
Chung-Sook can’t believe her ears. Surprise turns to anger.
MUN-KWANG (CONT’D)
Don’t worry, sis. No one knows 
I’m here. 
76. Mun-Kwang removes a pair of wire cutters from her pocket. 
MUN-KWANG (CONT’D)
I cut the wires on the 
surveillance camera on my way in. 
That’s good, right? Huh, big sis?
CHUNG-SOOK
Wait. Hold on. Aren’t you older 
than me?
MUN-KWANG
I was born in 74. Year of the 
tiger. My name is Mun-Kwang. 
Chung-Sook is speechless. Mun-Kwang points to Kun-Sae. 
MUN-KWANG (CONT’D)
This is my husband Oh Kun-Sae.
Kun-Sae smiles innocently as he continues to suck on the empty 
bottle. 
Chung-Sook regards the scene with disbelief. 
Mun-Kwang takes out a banana from her pocket. She peels it and 
feeds it to Kun-Sae. 
CHUNG-SOOK
So the whole time you were working 
here, you were smuggling food down 
from the kitchen?
MUN-KWANG
No! Everything he ate came from 
my pocket. From the money I made 
here. I never stole anything! 
CHUNG-SOOK
Sure. And how long has he been 
down here? Your husband. 
MUN-KWANG
Let’s see-- About four years? 
CHUNG-SOOK
You gotta be kidding me. 
KUN-SAE
Four years, three months, and 
seventeen days to be exact! 
Kun-Sae laughs. 
77. MUN-KWANG
That’s right. It’s already June. 
He started living here after Mr. 
Namgoong moved out four years ago. 
Before Da-Song’s family moved in. 
Chung-Sook looks around the room. It has a toilet, sink, small 
fridge, an old-fashioned TV set... Enough amenities to survive 
underground. 
Mun-Kwang continues to speak, blinking her swollen eyes. 
MUN-KWANG (CONT’D)
A lot of these rich people, they 
build bunkers and secret rooms in 
their homes. You know, in case 
the North Koreans invade, or in 
case creditors come knocking on 
their doors. Maybe Mr. Namgoong 
felt embarrassed about building 
such a room. He didn’t mention it 
to the Parks when he sold the 
house. 
CHUNG-SOOK
Huh. 
MUN-KWANG
Nobody in the house knew about the 
room. Except me. 
CHUNG-SOOK
Some balls you got. Well, now I 
know too! And I know what I’m 
going to do!
Chung-Sook takes out her phone.
CHUNG-SOOK (CONT’D)
Call the fucking cops. 
Mun-Kwang drops to her knees and starts begging.
MUN-KWANG
No! Please sis! 
(sobs)
We’re all in the same boat, aren’t 
we? We all need a little help to 
get by. 
CHUNG-SOOK
I’m not your fucking sister, 
bitch. And I don’t need nobody’s 
help. 
78. MUN-KWANG
Well, I do! I don’t have a house. 
I don’t have money. All I have is 
a mountain of debt. 
CHUNG-SOOK
What do you want me to do about 
it? 
MUN-KWANG
He’s been down here for four 
years, and the loan sharks still 
won’t let go. They’re obsessed. 
They say they’re going to kill 
him!
CHUNG-SOOK
You borrowed from loan sharks?
Mun-Kwang nods.
KUN-SAE
It’s all my fault.
(laughs, embarrassed)
I started a cake shop -- Taiwanese 
Castella -- and it completely 
bankrupted us. 
Kun-Sae laughs again. A nervous habit. 
When Ki-Tek hears the word ‘Castella,’ his face crowds with 
emotion. He knows the shame. 
Mun-Kwang hands Chung-Sook an envelope.
MUN-KWANG
Please, take this.
CHUNG-SOOK
What is this?
MUN-KWANG
It’s not much, I know. But I can 
send you money every month. All I 
ask is that you come down here 
every other day and leave him 
something to eat. Actually no. 
Once a week is fine. There’s a 
little fridge down here so--
CHUNG-SOOK
Are you crazy? You people are 
unbelievable-- Get away from me. 
Chung-Sook lifts her phone.
79. CHUNG-SOOK (CONT’D)
I’m going to call the cops. 
Ki-Tek and the kids look worried. That wouldn’t be good for 
them either. Ki-Tek is awkwardly leaning over, listening to 
the conversation, when -- 
His foot slips and he falls down the stairs! He is unable to 
control his large body and takes down Ki-Jung and Ki-Woo with 
him. Ki-Jung screams.
Chung-Sook is startled when she sees the family spilling down 
the stairs.
Mun-Kwang is even more confused. It’s Kevin, Jessica, and Mr. 
Kim! Why are they here? 
MUN-KWANG
What the hell?
KUN-SAE
(laughs)
Honey, who are all these people?
MUN-KWANG
Ms. Jessica? Mr. Kim... What’s 
everyone doing down here?
Mun-Kwang is speechless for a moment before the pieces slowly 
come together in her head. She takes out her cell phone. 
As Ki-Tek scrambles to get up, he accidentally steps on KiWoo’s foot. 
KI-WOO
Ow! Dad, my foot!
Chung-Sook and Ki-Jung immediately freeze. Ki-Woo realizes 
what he just said and turns pale. He sees -- 
Mun-Kwang recording everything on her cell phone. 
MUN-KWANG
Now I get it. 
(nods)
I knew something wasn’t right--
Mun-Kwang plays back the footage she just shot -- 
KI-WOO (VIDEO)
Ow! Dad, my foot!
Ki-Woo’s face and voice are clearly recorded on video.
80. Finally everything comes together for Mun-Kwang. 
Ki-Woo is devastated. 
MUN-KWANG
Now I get it. You’re all a 
family. A family that scams 
people together. 
KI-WOO
It’s not like that-- 
MUN-KWANG
I knew something was off when Yun 
was fired for no reason. You 
despicable-- 
CHUNG-SOOK
Listen, sis--
MUN-KWANG
I’m not your sister, you liferuining bitch. 
Mun-Kwang shows Chung-Sook her phone.
MUN-KWANG (CONT’D)
Why don’t I send this little video 
to Mrs. Park right now? 
The video is already being prepped for transfer on her 
messenger app. 
Ki-Woo and family are sweating. Ki-Tek, still a little tipsy 
from the whiskey, says quietly to Ki-Jung -- 
KI-TEK
There’s probably no reception down 
here. 
Ki-Jung looks at her phone.
KI-JUNG
Actually it’s pretty good. 
KI-TEK
Fuck.
KI-WOO
Please. We really need these 
jobs, and we went through a lot to 
get them. We’re not scam artists. 
We’re-- 
81. MUN-KWANG
(cutting him off)
Shut up! I don’t give a shit! I 
don’t care if we all go to prison. 
I’ll fucking end everything right 
here!
KI-TEK
SHUT UP!!!!
Ki-Tek thunders loudly, silencing everyone in the room. Ki-Woo 
frowns and covers his ears. 
KI-TEK (CONT’D)
Are you crazy, lady!
Mun-Kwang is puzzled by Ki-Tek’s random outburst.
KI-TEK (CONT’D)
Imagine how upset the Parks would 
be if they saw the video. 
(screaming)
They are nice people! And they’ve 
shown nothing but kindness! Why 
would you do that to them!
MUN-KWANG
What the--
KI-TEK
Erase it. Now. If you erase it-- 
(burps)
Then we can talk. Then I will 
consider your demands-- 
He seems to be doing the method-acting thing, playing ‘scary 
Ki-Tek,’ but no one’s really buying. He’s making zero sense. 
They all just look around. 
MUN-KWANG
(to Chung-Sook)
What’s wrong with your husband?
CHUNG-SOOK
(sighs)
I apologize on his behalf. Now 
let’s all calm down--
Kun-Sae is watching the drama unfold when he suddenly loses 
balance and nearly falls. He’s still weak. 
Mun-Kwang sticks her phone out like a gun as she grabs Kun-Sae 
-- 
82. 76 76
MUN-KWANG
Back off! Or I’m going to hit 
send!
Ki-Tek and family flinch. They slowly back off. 
MUN-KWANG (CONT’D)
Let’s get you upstairs. You need 
some fresh air.
KUN-SAE
(laughs)
Sounds good.
MUN-KWANG
All of you go upstairs and stay in 
one place. If you move one inch 
out of my sight, I’m hitting send!
INT. MANSION - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
It’s pouring outside. Kun-Sae is lying facedown on the large 
sofa, and Mun-Kwang is on top giving him a massage. 
Ki-Tek and crew are kneeling in the corner with their arms 
raised. 
KUN-SAE
It’s funny. Your phone. It’s 
like a nuclear button. 
MUN-KWANG
What are you talking about?
KUN-SAE
They all hide their tails when you 
say you’ll press the button.
(laughs)
You’re like North Korea. The 
phone is Kim Jong-Un’s nuke! 
Mun-Kwang sits up straight like a military cadet. 
MUN-KWANG
(North Korean accent)
Upon seeing the atrocious acts 
committed by the family of 
depraved bandits on mobile camera, 
our Dear Leader Kim Jong-Un 
determined to deliver fiery 
justice-- 
Out of nowhere she starts impersonating a North Korean news 
anchor. Kun-Sae laughs like a little kid. 
83. KUN-SAE
I missed your impressions. 
MUN-KWANG
Ignoring the cowardly ruling of 
the United Nations Security 
Council, our Dear Leader announced 
that he would execute the family 
of delinquents by firing squad. 
KUN-SAE
(laughing)
No one does commie impressions 
better than you. I love you, 
babe.
Ki-Tek and family stare at Mun-Kwang and Kun-Sae incredulously. 
Who are these people?
MUN-KWANG
What are you looking at! Keep 
your heads down!
They all look down. 
Mun-Kwang starts recording with her cell phone again, panning 
from the family members to the scattered food and booze bottles 
on the floor.
MUN-KWANG (CONT’D)
Scumbags. Look at this 
debauchery. This is how you treat 
the sublime living room created by 
the great Namgoong Hyunja? 
Kun-Sae looks out at the garden.
KUN-SAE
A great living room it is... 
Remember, honey? How we would sit 
here when the weather was nice, 
looking out at the garden. So 
enchanting. 
MUN-KWANG
It was. Park would be at work. 
The kids at school. Yon-Kyo would 
go out shopping, and the house 
would be so quiet. You would come 
up, and we would have tea 
together. 
KUN-SAE
Yes. Royal Milk Tea. 
84. 77 77
78 78
79 79
MUN-KWANG
We would enjoy the view, listening 
to Rachmaninoff on the bluetooth 
speaker-- 
Mun-Kwang is lost in sweet reverie when -- 
Chung-Sook suddenly runs toward the sofa. Like a linebacker 
rushing a quarterback, she rams the sofa with her hefty frame 
-- 
Knocking Mun-Kwang off balance and making her drop the phone! 
Immediately Ki-Tek dives after the phone --
While Mun-Kwang tries to retrieve it --
Then Ki-Woo lunges toward Mun-Kwang -- 
Then Kun-Sae after him --
And of course Ki-Jung has to jump after Kun-Sae. 
Six bodies desperately intertwined. Twelve hands clawing. 60 
fingers outstretched toward the phone. 
EXT. MANSION - NIGHT 
The view from outside. Through the thick curtain of rain, we 
see six people, none of whom actually live in the house, 
chaotically brawling inside. A surreal sight. The rain drowns 
out the sound. 
Ki-Jung extracts herself from the melee and runs toward the 
kitchen. 
INT. MANSION - KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Ki-Jung opens the fridge. She grabs a BLACK PLASTIC BAG from 
inside and runs back to the -- 
INT. MANSION - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Mun-Kwang has the phone back, but it’s far from over. ChungSook is choking her from behind, and Ki-Woo is beside her 
trying to pry the phone away. We see Ki-Tek wrestling Kun-Sae 
nearby. 
Ki-Jung rushes back to the living room with the black bag. She 
pours the contents -- A DOZEN OR SO PEACHES -- over Mun-Kwang’s 
head! 
85. 80 80
Mun-Kwang screams. 
Ki-Jung picks up one of the peaches and squashes it against 
Mun-Kwang’s face. 
MUN-KWANG
AAAAH!!
Mun-Kwang sticks her tongue out and starts coughing violently. 
She rolls on the floor, clutching her swollen throat, allowing 
-- 
Ki-Woo to snatch her phone. 
At the same time Ki-Tek subdues Kun-Sae, and the family seem to 
have everything under control. Until -- 
The LIVING ROOM PHONE begins to ring. 
Chung-Sook checks her cell phone. She sees several missed 
calls from “Mrs. Park.” Shit. 
When the landline continues to ring, the family members silence 
Mun-Kwang and Kun-Sae by covering their mouths. 
Chung-Sook answers the phone. 
CHUNG-SOOK
(into the phone)
Hel--lo?
YON-KYO (PHONE)
You’re there! You know how to 
make japaguri, right? Spicy 
jajang udon? 
CHUNG-SOOK
(into the phone)
Japaguri?
INT. MERCEDES - DRIVING - NIGHT 
YON-KYO
(into the phone)
It’s Da-Song’s favorite. If you 
start cooking now, it’ll be ready 
by the time we get there. There’s 
some Prime flank steak in the 
fridge so you should put that in 
too. 
Rain batters the Mercedes. Da-Song is in the backseat with his 
eyes closed. He looks pissed. He’s taken Da-Hae’s realitycanceling headphones and is wearing them over his ears. 
86. 81 81
Yon-Kyo glances back from the passenger seat. 
YON-KYO (CONT’D)
(into the phone; quiet)
It was complete hell. The stream 
at the campsite flooded and we had 
to pack up our tents, but Da-Song 
just refused to leave. He was 
crying and yelling--
(sighs)
We barely got him in the car, and 
now we’re on our way. I’m 
counting on the japaguri! It has 
to be ready!
INT. MANSION - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
CHUNG-SOOK
(pale)
So-- You’re almost here?
YON-KYO (PHONE)
Eight minutes, according to 
navigation. 
CHUNG-SOOK
I see... Eight minutes.
Ki-Tek, Ki-Woo, and Ki-Jung are completely aghast. 
YON-KYO (PHONE)
You should start now. You’re the 
best!
Yon-Kyo hangs up. 
The family members all look at each other blankly. What the 
fuck do we do? 
The living room is still wildly littered with whiskey bottles, 
plates, peaches... 
Chung-Sook closes her eyes and takes a deep breath. 
CHUNG-SOOK
(quiet)
What the hell is a japaguri?
KI-JUNG
Look it up. The recipe’s online. 
Ki-Woo is completely numb. He’s just standing there, still out 
of breath from the fracas, when -- 
87. 82 82
KI-JUNG (CONT’D)
(to Ki-Woo)
What do we do?
KI-WOO
I don’t know... This wasn’t part 
of the plan. 
They’re all standing around when Ki-Tek suddenly twists KunSae’s arm. Ki-Tek has a manic glow about him. His eyes are 
bloodshot. 
KUN-SAE
Ow!
KI-TEK
Move! Hurry! 
At Ki-Tek’s command, the family jump into action. 
Ki-Jung starts clearing the bottles with lightning speed, and 
Ki-Tek drags Kun-Sae toward the basement. 
Ki-Woo roughly pulls up Mun-Kwang. Her eyes are heavily 
swollen like she just went through ten rounds with Mike Tyson. 
She coughs incessantly as she is hauled away. 
Chung-Sook is solely focused on the japaguri. She looks up the 
recipe while putting water on the stove. She rips open two 
packs of noodles -- jajang ramen and instant udon. 
INT. MANSION - SECRET ROOM - NIGHT 
Ki-Tek pushes Kun-Sae down the stairs into the secret room. 
He’s rough, scary. And it’s not acting. 
Even in this dire situation, Kun-Sae can’t stop his laughing -- 
KUN-SAE
(laughing nervously)
You don’t have to do this. Let’s 
all sit down and talk. 
Ki-Tek shuts Kun-Sae up by throwing him on the floor. Ki-Tek 
then looks through the miscellaneous crap in the room and finds 
a power cord. He is tying Kun-Sae with it when -- 
Ki-Woo rushes down the stairs with Mun-Kwang. He also looks 
for something to tie Mun-Kwang with. She’s barely breathing 
and is only half-conscious. 
KI-TEK
I’ll take care of them. You go 
and help Ki-Jung. 
88. 83 83
KI-WOO
Okay. 
Ki-Woo is still numb. He has no focus in his eyes. No longer 
the man with the plan. He just does as he’s told. He hurries 
up the stairs. 
INT. MANSION - KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Chung-Sook methodically lays out the ramen soup packets on the 
counter and starts cooking the flank steak. 
Ki-Woo comes up from the basement. He runs past her and goes 
into the -- 
LIVING ROOM 
Where Ki-Jung is kicking foods and plates under the furniture. 
She moves fast, with purpose. Ki-Woo is looking at her blankly 
when -- 
He hears the Mercedes arriving in the garage. 
He panics. He sees Da-Hae’s yellow journal on top of the 
coffee table and picks it up. He hurries up to the second 
floor. 
Chung-Sook stirs the noodles with great speed. She soon hears 
the Park family walking up the garage stairs. 
Ki-Jung stops everything and picks up the remaining peaches. 
She hides under the large coffee table. 
A disgruntled Da-Song appears first and stalks across the 
living room. 
From under the coffee table, Ki-Jung sees -- 
Yon-Kyo running after Da-Song. She points to the kitchen. 
YON-KYO
Da-Song! Look what Chung-Sook 
made! It’s japaguri, your 
favorite!
Da-Song ignores the steaming bowl of japaguri and walks up the 
stairs. 
An equally pissed Da-Hae comes up behind him and snatches the 
headphones off his ears. She stomps ahead of him. 
89. 84 84
85 85
86 86
INT. MANSION - DA-HAE’S ROOM - NIGHT 
Ki-Woo closes the box of journals and puts the combination lock 
back on. He quickly hides under the bed.
Da-Hae walks inside moments later and throws herself on the 
bed. The bottom of the mattress sinks and nearly touches KiWoo’s nose. 
Da-Hae turns up the volume on her phone. Music escapes from 
her headphones. 
INT. MANSION - SECRET ROOM - NIGHT 
Ki-Tek finishes tying Kun-Sae and moves onto Mun-Kwang. She’s 
still hyperventilating, and her eyes are swollen shut. Ki-Tek 
approaches with the cord when -- 
Mun-Kwang suddenly gets up and shoves Ki-Tek to the side. She 
runs up the stairs. 
Ki-Tek chases her. 
INT. MANSION - KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Yon-Kyo gives up on talking to Da-Song. She walks down to the 
kitchen where Chung-Sook is waiting with the japaguri. 
At the same time, Chung-Sook sees Mun-Kwang running up from the 
storage basement. With the pot still in her hands, she swiftly 
turns toward the door and --
POW! -- Kicks Mun-Kwang in the face!
Mun-Kwang tumbles down and slams her head hard on one of the 
steps. Looks like at least a concussion. 
Ki-Tek witnesses the fall from below and gasps. 
Yon-Kyo walks into the kitchen, having missed the devastating 
kick by a mere millisecond. She sits at the dining table. 
YON-KYO
This is ridiculous. You should 
eat this. 
CHUNG-SOOK
Oh, thank you...
YON-KYO
Wait. No. I’ll give it to DongIk. You put the steak in, right?
90. 87 87
88 88
Chung-Sook is too worried about Mun-Kwang to be annoyed by YonKyo’s flip-flopping. She looks down at the bottom of stairs 
where -- 
Mun-Kwang lies unconscious with her head rammed into the wall. 
Ki-Tek soon drags her out of sight. 
INT. MANSION - STORAGE BASEMENT - NIGHT 
Ki-Tek pulls Mun-Kwang’s limp body through the steel door that 
leads to the secret room. He slides the cabinet back in place 
to cover the entrance. 
He sees that Mun-Kwang is unconscious and starts panicking. He 
slaps her in the face. He’s relieved when Mun-Kwang lets out a 
weak moan. 
Ki-Tek starts tying her with a cord when he hears a strange 
noise coming from below. He rushes down the stairs to see -- 
Kun-Sae, arms still tied, banging his head against a series of 
electrical switches on the wall. A truly bizarre sight. 
KI-TEK
What the hell are you doing?
KUN-SAE
Mr. Park is home. This is my 
welcome home ritual. 
Above Kun-Sae, Ki-Tek sees a tall, open space. The hollow area 
beneath the garage stairs. We hear Dong-Ik’s FOOTSTEPS heading 
up to the living room.
Kun-Sae continues to bang on the switches. Ki-Tek sees that 
the lines from the switches go all the way up to the entrance. 
KUN-SAE (CONT’D)
What are you staring at? I do 
this everyday. 
INT. MANSION - ENTRANCE - NIGHT 
As Dong-Ik walks up from the garage, the lights above him blink 
one by one, in sequence. That’s when we realize --
The MOTION-SENSOR LIGHTS that we noticed throughout the film 
weren’t motion-sensor lights after all. It was Kun-Sae’s 
‘performance’ welcoming Dong-Ik home. 
YON-KYO
Babe, have some japaguri. I put 
some steak in. 
91. 89 89
90 90
DONG-IK
(shakes his head)
No thanks. I’m going up to take a 
shower. 
INT. MANSION - SECRET ROOM - NIGHT 
Kun-Sae sings a silly, improvised song as he gleefully bangs 
the switches with his forehead -- 
KUN-SAE
(singing)
Welcome back, what a hard day you 
must have had at work / Welcome 
back, Mr. Park we love you so much
INT. MANSION - KITCHEN - NIGHT 
YON-KYO
(re: lights)
That sensor is all bonkers. 
Yon-Kyo talks to Chung-Sook as she shoves japaguri and flank 
steak in her mouth. She looks up. 
YON-KYO (CONT’D)
I guess there are still some 
things you need to learn about us. 
You think we’re weird right? 
(slurps ramen)
We go out of our way to indulge 
Da-Song. Treat him like some kind 
of crown prince. 
CHUNG-SOOK
Not at all--
YON-KYO
You have to understand. Da-Song 
needs special care. He’s... not 
well. We’ve been helping him with 
trauma therapy and art therapy. 
You see, he went through a 
traumatic event when he was 
little. 
CHUNG-SOOK
What kind of--
YON-KYO
Do you believe in ghosts?
CHUNG-SOOK
Ghosts?
92. YON-KYO
When Da-Song was in first grade, 
he saw a ghost. 
Yon-Kyo tells the story as she noisily slurps her ramen. 
Chung-Sook’s spine tingles. A creepy silence surrounds the 
kitchen. 
Ki-Jung listens intently from under the coffee table. 
YON-KYO (CONT’D)
That year we threw him a big 
birthday party at home. At night, 
when we were all asleep, Da-Song 
snuck back down to the kitchen 
because he couldn’t stop thinking 
about the cake. You see, the 
fresh cream on that cake was just 
divine. 
CHUNG-SOOK
Right.
YON-KYO
He was crouched over there in 
front of the refrigerator, eating 
cake with his fingers when --
Chung-Sook is riveted. 
YON-KYO (CONT’D)
He saw something. Over there. In 
the living room window. A dark 
figure-- 
CHUNG-SOOK
(spooked)
In the garden?
YON-KYO
No, in the kitchen.
Yon-Kyo points to the living room window. 
YON-KYO (CONT’D)
See? You can see the kitchen 
reflected in the window.
CHUNG-SOOK
My goodness.
YON-KYO
He saw a dark figure looking over 
his shoulders. A ghost. 
93. As CAMERA WHIP PANS to the living room window, we transition to 
a -- 
FLASHBACK 
We see the kitchen reflected in the living room window. DaSong is sitting on the floor plowing into his cake. 
We see a DARK FIGURE behind Da-Song. The ghost. He just 
stands there, watching Da-Song eat. 
BACK TO PRESENT 
YON-KYO (CONT’D)
I heard a scream and rushed down 
the stairs. 
(tears building)
When I found him, his eyes were 
rolled back, and he was foaming at 
the mouth, shaking uncontrollably 
-- 
CHUNG-SOOK
Oh my gosh.
YON-KYO
Have you seen a child going 
through a seizure? It’s awful. 
If you don’t perform first aid in 
the first fifteen minutes, it’s 
over. You have to take him to the 
hospital as soon as you can. 
Yon-Kyo shakes off the memories and returns to her ditzy self. 
YON-KYO (CONT’D)
Dong-Ik was away on a business 
trip, and I was all by myself. 
Anyway, after that horrible 
experience, we’ve tried to go away 
for his birthday every year. Last 
year we went to my parents’ house. 
This year, camping--
She angrily tosses her noodles. 
YON-KYO (CONT’D)
Now it’s all gone to crap. 
CHUNG-SOOK
I see. 
Chung-Sook realizes who the ghost was but keeps mum. 
94. 91 91
YON-KYO
Dong-Ik doesn’t take it seriously. 
Growing pains, he says. And he 
says living in a haunted house 
actually brings good fortune. 
Good for business or something. 
(slurps ramen)
You know what though? Business 
has been very good these past few 
years. It’s funny-- 
As Yon-Kyo rambles on -- 
CAMERA MOVES IN on Da-Song’s drawing on the wall. It focuses 
on the “schizophrenia zone.” We see the dark, ambiguous shape 
drawn in it.
The shape, which vaguely resembles the ghost, MATCH CUTS TO --
INT. MANSION - SECRET ROOM - NIGHT 
Kun-Sae’s dark face staring back at Ki-Tek. 
Ki-Tek looks at the numerous notes and drawings covering the 
walls. He sees photos and magazine interviews of Namgoong 
Hyunja and Dong-Ik. A record of Kun-Sae’s devolving mind.
Ki-Tek feels like he’s in the twilight zone. 
KI-TEK
God... I can’t believe you lived 
here for so long. I guess you had 
no choice...
KUN-SAE
Plenty of people live underground. 
More if you count semi-underground 
apartments! 
Kun-Sae laughs. 
KI-TEK
So what was your plan? You didn’t 
even have one, did you?
KUN-SAE
(laughing)
I like it here. It almost feels 
like I grew up here. This might 
as well be my official address. 
Kun-Sae rambles on incoherently, his eyes glazed and out of 
focus. 
95. 92 92
93 93
Ki-Tek starts getting scared. 
KUN-SAE (CONT’D)
Please. You have to let me stay 
here. 
Ki-Tek finds a roll of duct tape among the mess and starts 
ripping off a piece. 
KUN-SAE (CONT’D)
Please. Talk to my wife. We 
don’t have to fight.
(looking around)
Where did she go? She didn’t mean 
what she said. The woman really 
has a heart of gold. She stood by 
me the whole time I was in here. 
Four long years--
Ki-Tek tapes Kun-Sae’s mouth shut. He then goes to stairs and 
tapes Mun-Kwang’s mouth as well. As he does, he feels 
something wet behind her head. BLOOD. 
Ki-Tek’s head spins when he sees the blood on his fingertips. 
He runs up the stairs. 
INT. MANSION - STORAGE BASEMENT - NIGHT 
Ki-Tek shuts the steel door and ties the handle with wires. He 
then pushes the cabinet back in place, sealing off the secret 
doorway. Breathing heavily, he looks up at the thin bar of 
light coming from the kitchen. 
INT. MANSION - DA-HAE’S ROOM - NIGHT 
We’re on Ki-Woo’s stunned face. He is face to face with -- 
JUNIE, who is poking his head under the mattress, having found 
Ki-Woo. 
Da-Hae looks down at Junie from the bed. She becomes curious 
when she sees the dog wagging his tail with his head buried 
under the bed. She bends over to see what it is when --
She hears Yon-Kyo walking up the stairs. She immediately 
springs back up. Picking up Junie, she walks out to the -- 
HALLWAY
Where she confronts Yon-Kyo. 
DA-HAE
You’re unbelievable. 
96. 94 94
YON-KYO
What?
DA-HAE
You didn’t even ask me. I like 
japaguri too.
Yon-Kyo wipes her mouth. 
YON-KYO
I just--
DA-HAE
Da-Song didn’t want it so you 
offered it to Chung-Sook. Then 
you gave it to Dad. Then instead 
of asking me, you decided to eat 
it all by yourself. What, I 
didn’t cross your mind? 
Da-Hae and Yon-Kyo bicker down the hall, soon disappearing from 
our sight. 
Through Da-Hae’s open door, we see Ki-Woo slowly emerging from 
under the bed. He checks the hallway before tiptoeing over to 
the stairs, where he sees -- 
Chung-Sook waving at him from below ‘Come down.’ Chung-Sook 
also gestures toward the basement stairs from which -- 
Ki-Tek carefully walks out. Once they’re all together they 
start toward the -- 
INT. MANSION - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
The family quietly crosses the living room toward the garage 
entrance. They stop. They make a quick detour to the coffee 
table where Ki-Jung is still hiding. 
They are helping her out from under the table when they 
suddenly hear -- 
FOOTSTEPS thundering down the stairs. Fast. 
Ki-Jung hides under the table again. Having nowhere to go, KiWoo and Ki-Tek also crawl underneath. 
Chung-Sook turns to see --
Da-Song running down the stairs, dressed in a raincoat. He’s 
wearing a backpack and also has the folded TEEPEE strapped 
across his shoulders. 
97. CHUNG-SOOK
Da-Song! Slow down!
Dangling all kinds of camping gear over his raincoat, Da-Song 
storms through the living room and heads to the garden. He 
opens the glass door and jumps out into the pouring rain. 
He then starts building the teepee in the middle of the yard. 
He’s quick, efficient. A true Scout. 
Yon-Kyo and Dong-Ik yell at Da-Song as they rush down the 
stairs. 
YON-KYO
Da-Song! Are you crazy!
DONG-IK
Da-Song Park! 
(laughs)
I can’t believe this. 
Yon-Kyo and Dong-Ik hesitate at the door, still in their 
pajamas. Chung-Sook brings two umbrellas, and they finally go 
out. 
Da-Song has already finished setting up the teepee and is now 
working on the inside. 
Ki-Tek, Ki-Woo and Ki-Jung attempt to make a run while Yon-Kyo 
and Dong-Ik are outside. They start wiggling their way out 
when -- 
Da-Hae comes running down the stairs. 
They quickly wiggle back in. 
DA-HAE
(English)
What the fuck is going on here? 
Da-Hae watches her parents pleading with Da-Song in the rain. 
Pathetic. She shoots a video and sends it to none other than 
-- 
“Mr. Kevin” a.k.a. Ki-Woo
Whose phone VIBRATES just a few feet from her under the table. 
Ki-Woo quickly silences his phone.
Chung-Sook coughs to cover the sound. She glances over at DaHae to see if Da-Hae heard it too. 
She did. Da-Hae looks around, confused. 
98. Ki-Woo hurriedly switches his phone to silence mode. Ki-Tek 
and Ki-Jung do the same. 
Da-Hae’s text messages crowd Ki-Woo’s screen -- 
/ SMH Da-Song’s crazy raindance
/ I hate my brother
/ Totes saw this coming. Started losing his shit at camp 
/ LMAO 
/ I miss you 
/ Me too
/ Selfie please
/ No 
/ Why noooooooot
/ I’m with you right now
Da-Hae continues to exchange cringe-inducing love texts with 
Ki-Woo as she plops down on the sofa. 
Ki-Tek, Ki-Woo, and Ki-Jung nearly shriek when Da-Hae’s wriggly 
feet come within inches of their faces. 
Meanwhile Yon-Kyo and Dong-Ik give up on Da-Song and return to 
the living room. 
Chung-Sook takes their umbrellas and hands them a couple of 
towels. She nervously looks over at the coffee table. 
YON-KYO
(to Chung-Sook)
You should go sleep in the room. 
We’ll stay here with Da-Song. 
DONG-IK
(to Da-Hae)
You too. Stop looking at your 
phone and go to your room. 
Without answering, Da-Hae gets up and stomps up the stairs, 
never looking up once from her phone. 
Chung-Sook looks back at the living room with a worried face as 
she goes to the kitchen. 
Yon-Kyo and Dong-Ik sit down on the sofa, now directly facing 
Ki-Tek, Ki-Woo, and Ki-Jung. 
99. Dong-Ik presses the button on his walkie-talkie. 
DONG-IK (CONT’D)
(into the radio)
Dad to Da-Song, Dad to Da-Song. 
Currently standing by in the 
living room. I’ll be here all 
night so call me if there’s an 
emergency.
DA-SONG (RADIO)
Copy that. Over and out. 
Da-Song’s voice on the radio sounds excited. He got his wish 
after all. Dong-Ik lets out a weak laugh. 
DONG-IK
This is incredible. You don’t 
think the teepee will leak, do 
you?
YON-KYO
(sighs)
I bought it directly from an 
American vendor. I think it 
should be okay. 
DONG-IK
Your son is quite unpredictable. 
Never easy, I’ll say. 
Yon-Kyo feels like it’s her fault. 
YON-KYO
He’s been getting better... Look. 
Signing him up for the Cub Scouts 
definitely paid off. See how fast 
he set up that tent. 
Outside the window, the teepee lights up. Lanterns are lit 
inside, one after another. 
It’s picturesque. The teepee, emitting a pleasant orange glow. 
Against the backdrop of beautiful trees. Seen through the 
shimmering veil of pouring rain. 
Dong-Ik turns off the living room lights and places a few 
cushions on Yon-Kyo’s side. 
DONG-IK
Let’s just sleep here on the sofa 
tonight. We’ll be able to see the 
tent from here. 
YON-KYO
That sounds good. That way we can 
keep an eye on Da-Song. 
100. Ki-Tek, Ki-Woo, and Ki-Jung turn ashen. They’re fucked. 
Dong-Ik lies down in the spooning position behind Yon-Kyo. 
It’s quite romantic. Both of them in their pajamas. Tightly 
snuggled up on the sofa. 
DONG-IK
Hold on. 
(sniffs)
I know that smell. 
YON-KYO
What?
DONG-IK
This is Mr. Kim’s smell. 
YON-KYO
Mr. Kim? Are you sure?
(sniffs)
I don’t know what you’re talking 
about.
Dong-Ik and Yon-Kyo both sniff the air. 
Ki-Tek becomes nervous. He smells his T-shirt. 
DONG-IK
I guess you don’t know. I sit 
behind him every day so I know the 
smell. 
YON-KYO
Like poor people smell? 
DONG-IK
No. It’s not that strong. It’s 
more like a subtle aroma that 
seeps into the air-- 
YON-KYO
Like old people smell?
DONG-IK
No, no. How should I put it-- 
Maybe the smell of an old radish 
pickle? Or that smell when you’re 
washing a dirty rag? 
Ki-Tek tries his best to keep a straight face under the table. 
DONG-IK (CONT’D)
I mean I like his driving. And 
the man never crosses the line. 
 (MORE)
101. DONG-IK (CONT’D)
Sometimes he teeters very close, 
but he never actually crosses it. 
That’s all great. But that smell. 
It definitely crosses the line. 
(laughs)
It just creeps into the backseat 
and surrounds you-- 
YON-KYO
You think that’s what Da-Song was 
talking about?
DONG-IK
It’s hard to explain. I smell it 
when I ride the subway sometimes. 
YON-KYO
I haven’t ridden the subway in 
forever.
DONG-IK
There’s this unique smell that 
subway commuters have--
Ki-Tek, Ki-Woo, and Ki-Jung can do nothing but silently take 
hit after hit. Ki-Tek is completely expressionless. 
On the sofa, Dong-Ik slowly slides up his hand and caresses 
Yon-Kyo’s breasts over her pajama top. 
YON-KYO
(quiet)
What are you doing?
DONG-IK
It feels like we’re in the 
backseat of a car, doesn’t it?
Dong-Ik sounds like a horny high school boy. He puts his hand 
inside Yon-Kyo’s pajama top and continues fondling her. 
Yon-Kyo looks up at the kitchen and the stairs to make sure no 
one is watching. She closes her eyes and gives in to pleasure. 
YON-KYO
(moaning)
Clockwise. 
Dong-Ik moves his hand as instructed. It starts migrating 
below Yon-Kyo’s navel. Their bodies grow closer. Breathing 
becomes labored. 
DONG-IK
Do you have a pair of really cheap 
panties?
102. 95 95
YON-KYO
Cheap panties?
DONG-IK
Those panties that Yun left 
behind. Something like that. 
Real cheap and tacky. 
Dong-Ik’s hand slips inside Yon-Kyo’s underwear. He makes it 
‘vibrate’ like a sex toy. 
Yon-Kyo’s lips part from pleasure. She gasps. 
YON-KYO
No, I don’t have-- something so 
crude. 
DONG-IK
I must be a pervert. I get hard 
thinking about those cheap, trashy 
pair of underpants.
YON-KYO
Where would I find something so-- 
horrendous.
(gasps)
Down. 
Ki-Jung tries to keep a cool face as the rich couple continue 
to malign her underwear. 
Ki-Tek’s face is dark. He’s more humiliated than she is. 
Meanwhile Yon-Kyo is pushed closer toward climax by the 
underpants talk. She bites her lips but is hardly able to 
suppress her moans. Ki-Tek, Ki-Woo, and Ki-Jung hear 
everything under the table. 
A heavy fatigue comes over Ki-Tek’s face. Time passes slowly. 
INT. MANSION - LIVING ROOM - LATER 
Hiding in the dark kitchen, Chung-Sook looks over at the living 
room where the Parks are now sleeping. She sends a text --
/ They’re passed out
/ Move out 1 by 1 
Under the table, Ki-Tek receives the text. He signals Ki-Jung 
to go first. She slides out and starts crawling toward the 
garage stairs. Ki-Woo goes next. Once they are safely across, 
they wait for Ki-Tek. 
103. 96 96
97 97
Ki-Tek is slowly making his way when -- 
A STRONG BEAM OF LIGHT suddenly penetrates the living room. A 
flashlight. Ki-Tek quickly flattens himself on the floor. The 
light searches the living room before settling on Yon-Kyo and 
Dong-Ik on the sofa. 
EXT. MANSION - GARDEN - NIGHT 
The rain is still heavy. We see Da-Song poking his head out, 
shining his flashlight at Yon-Kyo and Dong-Ik in the living 
room. 
He turns glum when he sees them sleeping. He angrily waves the 
flashlight, trying to wake them up. 
INT. MANSION - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Ki-Tek curls into a tight ball to avoid the wildly roaming 
light. He is slowly inching toward the stairs when -- 
The T-667 WALKIE-TALKIE on the coffee table crackles to life. 
We hear Da-Song’s voice through the fuzz -- 
DA-SONG (RADIO)
Mayday! Mayday! Dad, come in!
Ki-Tek freezes. There’s nowhere to hide. He can only close 
his eyes and hope he doesn’t get discovered.
Dong-Ik wakes up and picks up the walkie-talkie. He looks out 
the window and sees the flashlight blinking inside the tent. 
DONG-IK
(into the radio)
What is it?
YON-KYO
Is that Da-Song ? What’s going 
on?
Yon-Kyo and Dong-Ik are too concerned with Da-Song to notice 
Ki-Tek hunched over in the dark merely a few feet away. 
DA-SONG (RADIO)
I can’t go to sleep. Over.
Dong-Ik and Yon-Kyo can’t help but laugh. 
DONG-IK
(into the radio)
So come inside! Let’s all go to 
sleep in our comfy beds.
104. 98 98
99 99
100 100
101 101
DA-SONG (RADIO)
No!
The transmission cuts out. Dong-Ik and Yon-Kyo laugh and sigh. 
Back to the sofa it is. They return to sleep. 
When all is quiet, Ki-Tek starts moving again. 
INT. MANSION - GARAGE - NIGHT 
Ki-Tek flips up the door switch before quickly flipping it back 
down. The garage door goes up about one-and-a-half feet before 
stopping. 
Ki-Jung and Ki-Woo hold their breath. Did anyone in the house 
hear the door? 
When they don’t hear anything, they crawl through the narrow 
opening and walk out into the rain.
Ki-Tek presses the ‘down’ switch and slips through the crack 
before it completely closes.
EXT. MANSION - ROAD - NIGHT 
HIGH ON the surveillance camera above the gate, the severed 
wires dangling below. RACK FOCUS TO REVEAL -- 
Ki-Tek, Ki-Woo, and Ki-Jung sneaking out of the house and 
walking down the empty road. Rain pours as they make their way 
down the winding road. 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
Ki-Tek and the kids trudge silently through the rain. They’re 
walking on the side of a gloomy four-lane road, no longer in 
the nice part of town. They don’t bother going into a store to 
buy an umbrella. They don’t bother hailing a cab. They just 
walk, their faces steeped in anguish. 
EXT. HILLTOP - NIGHT 
We look down on a hillside neighborhood. A different hillside 
view. Working class. Illuminated by the lights of low-income 
apartments. The gates of poverty. 
Ki-Tek, Ki-Woo, and Ki-Jung stop under an overpass, out of 
breath. We see them as silhouettes. 
KI-JUNG
(panting)
So what did you do? 
105. KI-TEK
What are you talking about?
KI-JUNG
The basement.
KI-TEK
I tied them up so they can’t come 
out. 
KI-JUNG
What are we going to do?
Ki-Tek is silent. 
KI-JUNG (CONT’D)
What do we do now? What’s the 
goddamn plan?
Ki-Tek doesn’t have one. Rain drowns the silence. 
Ki-Woo, still in a daze, mumbles to himself -- 
KI-WOO
What would Min-Hyuk do?
KI-JUNG
Min-Hyuk wouldn’t have gotten 
himself in this mess in the first 
place!
Ki-Jung is about to lash out further when Ki-Tek calmly steps 
forward. 
KI-TEK
Calm down. Both of you.
Ki-Jung seethes. 
KI-TEK (CONT’D)
We made it out of that house, 
didn’t we? 
KI-WOO
We did.
KI-TEK
No one else knows about what 
happened in the house. Am I 
right? 
Ki-Jung nods.
KI-TEK (CONT’D)
So as far as I’m concerned nothing 
happened in there. Do you 
understand? 
106. 102 102
103 103
Ki-Tek sounds like a real father. Firm. Reassuring. 
Ki-Jung actually listens to him. 
KI-TEK (CONT’D)
I know what I’m doing. Daddy has 
a plan. So you two just erase 
everything that happened today 
from your memory.
KI-JUNG
Okay.
Ki-Woo nods.
KI-TEK
Let’s go home and wash up. 
With that, Ki-Tek steps back into the rain. Ki-Woo and Ki-Jung 
follow. 
UNSETTLING MUSIC creeps in over the rain. 
EXT. KI-TEK’S NEIGHBORHOOD - STREET - NIGHT 
Ki-Tek, Ki-Woo, and Ki-Jung walk through the relentless 
downpour, passing shabby, low-rent buildings. They hear 
SHOUTING, SIRENS in the distance. They turn the corner to see 
-- 
A completely flooded alley! All the roads leading to their 
apartment are covered in knee-deep water.
Total pandemonium. Sewage backflows. A SEMI-BASEMENT RESIDENT 
scoops water out of his apartment with a bucket. 
Ki-Tek stares in horror. He hurries toward the apartment. KiWoo and Ki-Jung splash in after him. 
INT. SEMI-BASEMENT - ENTRANCE - NIGHT 
Ki-Tek has to use great strength to open the door. He steps 
inside to see brown flood water pouring in through the window. 
The water is already up to his chest. 
His foot touches something, and he reaches into the dirty water 
to pick up -- 
A live KING CRAB flailing its legs. 
Ki-Tek stares at the crab. It’s too surreal. His home has 
become an underwater habitat. He throws the crab away. His 
face fills with despair. 
107. 104 104
105 105
106 106
Meanwhile Ki-Woo crosses toward the window. He tries to close 
it to stop further flooding when -- 
KI-WOO
Ow!
He feels a shock of electricity as soon as he touches it. He 
quickly withdraws his hand. 
KI-TEK
Were you shocked? Don’t touch it! 
Don’t touch the windows! Just get 
what you need!
INT. SEMI-BASEMENT - BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Ki-Jung pries the door open and trudges toward the toilet, 
which is spewing shit water like an Icelandic geyser. 
Ki-Jung barely closes the lid and climbs on top. She opens a 
square panel on the ceiling and reaches in to find -- 
A PACK OF CIGARETTES AND A LIGHTER that she had hidden there. 
We see a few folded bills stashed in the cellophane wrap. 
Ki-Jung lights a cigarette amidst the raging flood. The 
surging sewage lifts her toilet seat up and down. 
INT. SEMI-BASEMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Ki-Woo is going around packing a few essentials into a GRAY BAG 
when --
Something touches his foot in the water. He bends over and 
reaches into the murky depths, eventually finding -- 
The VIEWING STONE that Min-Hyuk gave the family as a gift.
Ki-Woo pants heavily as he hugs the rock. It’s like he just 
found a precious treasure. 
Over the image of the stone veiled by the hazy, undulating 
water, DARK MUSIC begins to play.
INT. MANSION - SECRET ROOM - NIGHT 
Kun-Sae is facing away from Mun-Kwang, straining to remove the 
tape off her mouth with his tied-up hands.
Mun-Kwang sweats profusely and falls in and out of 
consciousness. When Kun-Sae finally rips off the tape -- 
108. 107 107
Mun-Kwang jumps up and staggers toward the toilet.
Kun-Sae watches in horror as she throws up into the bowl. 
KUN-SAE
(through tape)
Mmm-mmmm! (Mun-Kwang!)
Mun-Kwang moans. She’s in a lot of pain. She gets up and 
starts toward Kun-Sae but loses her balance. 
Kun-Sae throws himself to catch her, but she falls flat on the 
floor. 
MUN-KWANG
Vomiting is a symptom of--
Kun-Sae screams something to Mun-Kwang, but his cries are 
muffled by the tape on his mouth. They’re heard as primal, 
animalistic grunts. 
MUN-KWANG (CONT’D)
It’s supposed to be a symptom of-- 
Kun-Sae stares helplessly. 
MUN-KWANG (CONT’D)
(weak)
Honey--
(laughs)
Chung-Sook. She-- That bitch 
kicked me in the face-- 
Mun-Kwang laughs like her husband, mumbling incoherently. Her 
voice dwindles. She’s near the end. She curls up in the 
corner next to the toilet. 
Kun-Sae shouts through the tape. He wails painfully like a 
hurt beast. The scream continues over to -- 
INT. SEMI-BASEMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
The water is now up to Ki-Tek’s chin. He stands at the 
entrance and looks back at the apartment like a captain taking 
one last look at his sinking ship. 
The water inside has merged with the floodwater on the street 
and has formed a continuous brown ocean extending throughout 
the neighborhood. 
UNNERVING MUSIC continues. A dark wave of water rolls over the 
screen and we CUT TO -- 
109. 108 108
109 109
110 110
INT. MANSION - SECRET ROOM - NIGHT 
Inside the dark room, we find a crazed Kun-Sae banging on the 
wall switches with his bloody forehead. His face is a mask of 
sweat, blood, snot. 
We see Mun-Kwang’s lifeless body on the floor behind him. 
Kun-Sae furiously bangs the switches with his head, overcome 
with pain and sorrow. 
INT/EXT. MANSION - DA-SONG’S TEEPEE - NIGHT 
Da-Song unzips the tent and looks at the living room across the 
garden. He sees the lights blinking randomly in the front 
entrance. 
He starts timing the blinks. He takes out his notebook and 
starts transcribing them as dots and dashes. He consults the 
MORSE CODE CHART in the back of his Cub Scout book but can’t 
seem to make out any words. 
CAMERA TRACKS IN on the lights as they blink more and more 
frantically. UNSETTLING MUSIC reaches a crescendo. 
INT. SCHOOL GYM - EVACUATION CENTER - EARLY MORNING 
Filled with rows and rows of EVACUEES from flooded areas. 
Currently sleeping. The lights are off, and the gym is 
illuminated by the faint glow of daybreak. 
Ki-Tek and the kids are among the Evacuees. Ki-Jung is 
completely knocked out. It’s been a rough night.
Ki-Woo tightly holds the viewing stone as he lies wide awake. 
His eyes are bloodshot. 
KI-WOO
Hey, Dad.
KI-TEK
Hey... 
KI-WOO
So--
Ki-Woo looks at Ki-Jung to make sure she is sleeping.
KI-WOO (CONT’D)
Your plan. What is it?
KI-TEK
What are you talking about?
110. KI-WOO
You said you had a plan. What are 
we going to do about--
(quiet)
The basement. 
Ki-Tek is silent for a long moment. His face is cold and 
emotionless. 
KI-TEK
Do you want to know how you make a 
foolproof plan?
KI-WOO
How?
KI-TEK
Don’t plan at all. Have no plan.
Ki-Woo, confused. 
KI-TEK (CONT’D)
If you plan, something will always 
go wrong. That’s life.
(then)
Look around. Do you think these 
people got up this morning and 
said “Tonight I’m going to sleep 
on a dirty floor with hundreds of 
strangers”? But look where they 
are now. Look where we are.
Ki-woo is hardly consoled. 
KI-TEK (CONT’D)
That’s why you should never plan. 
If you don’t have a plan, you 
can’t fail. You can’t do anything 
wrong. Doesn’t matter if you kill 
someone or commit fucking treason. 
Nothing fucking matters. You 
understand? 
Ki-Tek talks quietly. There’s a hostility in his voice. His 
face drips with fatigue. 
Ki-Woo is scared. He’s never seen his father like this. He 
hugs the rock more tightly. 
KI-WOO
I’m sorry, Dad.
KI-TEK
For what?
111. 111 111
112 112
KI-WOO
Everything. I’m going to make it 
right. 
KI-TEK
Stop talking nonsense. 
(re: viewing stone)
Why are you hugging that thing?
KI-WOO
This?
Ki-Woo looks down at the stone. 
KI-WOO (CONT’D)
It wants to be with me.
Ki-Tek looks at Ki-Woo. He’s acting strange.
KI-WOO (CONT’D)
It’s true. It keeps following me.
KI-TEK
Get some sleep.
KI-WOO
(to himself)
I knew it was a sign when Min-Hyuk 
gave it to me. A symbolic gift...
Ki-Woo stares blankly ahead. We have no idea what he’s 
thinking. 
INT. MANSION - LIVING ROOM - MORNING 
Sunlight fills the living room. Yon-Kyo walks up to the window 
and looks up at the marvelous sky. She sees the tent in the 
garden. 
Dong-Ik slowly rises from the sofa behind her. 
EXT. MANSION - GARDEN - MORNING 
Dong-Ik walks over to the raindrop-covered teepee and carefully 
peeks inside -- 
Da-Song is finally asleep after the long and eventful night. 
Dong-Ik smiles and gives the okay sign to Yon-Kyo in the living 
room. 
112. 113 113
114 114
115 115
INT. MANSION - DRESSING ROOM - MORNING 
YON-KYO
(into the phone)
Jessica! Sorry to call you so 
early on a Sunday. Are you free 
for lunch today? We’re planning a 
surprise party for Da-Song.
Yon-Kyo is sitting at her vanity, chatting excitedly into her 
phone. It’s on speaker. 
INT. SCHOOL GYM - MORNING 
A groggy Ki-Jung answers the phone. We see rows of people 
sleeping behind her. 
KI-JUNG
(into the phone)
You’re having a birthday party?
YON-KYO (PHONE)
Yes. Da-Song would be so thrilled 
to see you there. 
INT. MANSION - DRESSING ROOM - MORNING 
YON-KYO
(into the phone)
The food will be amazing. Pasta, 
gratin, salmon steak... You know 
I’m an excellent chef, right? You 
have to come.
KI-JUNG (PHONE)
Sure... 
YON-KYO
(into the phone)
You have to be here by one 
o’clock at the latest. And we’ll 
count today as a lesson. 
(English)
You know what I mean?
(Korean)
See you very soon!
Yon-Kyo lays down a barrage before abruptly hanging up. 
We see Da-Hae standing behind Yon-Kyo. She looks over her 
mom’s shoulders with twinkling eyes. 
113. 116 116
DA-HAE
Hey, Mom. The birthday party-- 
Should I invite Kevin?
YON-KYO
(turning back)
What an excellent idea! Why not? 
You call him. 
DA-HAE
On it! 
Da-Hae, ecstatic, runs to her room. As she does -- 
We see Dong-Ik coming up the stairs behind her. He walks into 
the master bedroom and throws himself on the bed. He crawls 
under the covers to go back to sleep. 
Yon-Kyo calls him from the dressing room -- 
YON-KYO
Sleep, sleep. You had a long 
night. You need some more rest. 
DONG-IK
Thanks. 
(yawns)
Don’t you have to do the rounds?
YON-KYO
Yep. Wine shop, bakery, florist, 
grocery store-- I’m on top of it. 
I already called Mr. Kim and told 
him to come early. I’m going to 
pay him extra for today. 
DONG-IK
Perfect.
Dong-Ik gives her a thumbs up with his eyes closed. 
Yon-Kyo smiles, pleased with Dong-Ik’s approval. She opens the 
closet. 
INT. SCHOOL GYM - MORNING 
Evacuees surround a pile of SECOND-HAND CLOTHES, looking for 
something salvageable. Donations from a local organization. 
Ki-Jung looks frustrated. She doesn’t see anything appropriate 
for the party. 
She looks at Ki-Tek, who is also frantically digging through 
the pile with bloodshot eyes. 
114. 117 117
Behind them, Ki-Woo is still lying on the floor. He opens his 
eyes and looks at his phone -- 
“7 Missed Calls - Da-Hae”
Ki-Woo sits up and goes through Da-Hae’s text messages. He 
puts the VIEWING STONE in the gray bag. 
INT. MANSION - KITCHEN / LIVING ROOM - MORNING 
Chung-Sook busily prepares ingredients for the party. Her eyes 
are red. She hasn’t slept at all. 
A refreshed Yon-Kyo hops down the stairs and calls Chung-Sook 
out to the living room. She looks out at the sunny garden. 
YON-KYO
I want you to go to the storage 
basement. We should have about 
ten party tables in there. 
CHUNG-SOOK
Okay...
YON-KYO
Let’s bring them all out. Clean 
them so they’re bright and shiny. 
We’ll set them up in a semi-circle 
around Da-Song’s tent--
Yon-Kyo tries to show Chung-Sook with her hands. No, not quite 
right. Then -- 
YON-KYO (CONT’D)
Crane Formation! You know, right? 
The formation that General Yi Soon 
Shin famously used during the 
Battle of Hansan Island. 
Chung-Sook’s face says, ‘How the fuck should I know.” She 
quickly hides her expression. 
YON-KYO (CONT’D)
Think of Da-Song’s tent as a 
Japanese battleship. We’ll 
surround it in a semi-circle, like 
the wings of a crane. The 
barbecue grill will go next to the 
tent--

INT. MANSION - STORAGE BASEMENT - MORNING 
Chung-Sook struggles to pull out the party tables from the 
faintly lit basement. She stops to take a breath. A chilling 
silence envelops the room. 
Chung-Sook looks at the jar cabinet covering the secret door. 
She can almost hear Mun-Kwang and Kun-Sae’s breathing coming 
from the other side. She stares at the cabinet for a long 
time. 
INT. ORGANIC FOOD STORE - MORNING 
An upscale food market. Organic produce beautifully displayed. 
Ki-Tek is at the cash register bagging items as a CASHIER scans 
them. 
Yon-Kyo is next to him talking on the phone. 
YON-KYO
(laughing)
That sounds great. Bring your 
husband too! And please -- don’t 
bring any gifts. 
Yon-Kyo hands the Cashier her credit card.
YON-KYO (CONT’D)
I just want you to come and enjoy 
the food!
It seems like it’s going to be a large-scale affair. Ki-Tek 
follows Yon-Kyo out with huge bags of fruits and vegetables. 
Yon-Kyo’s shrill laughter puts Ki-Tek on edge. He squints his 
bloodshot eyes. 
YON-KYO (CONT’D)
(into the phone)
Come. You can take a break from 
cooking today.
(nodding)
Yes, of course. Daytime is the 
best time for vino! 
(laughs)
Well, we’d be so grateful if you 
could sing a song at the party. 
INT. WINE SHOP - MORNING 
YON-KYO
 (MORE)
116. 121 121
122 122
YON-KYO (CONT’D)
(into the phone)
No dress code. It’s just a casual 
affair. You can come in your 
pajamas if you want.
(laughs)
And please, no gifts. I just want 
you to come and enjoy. That’ll be 
the best gift for us. 
(then)
You have a Mini Cooper, right? 
Great. We can squeeze it in next 
to our car. It’ll fit just fine. 
Yon-Kyo talks on the phone as she walks past fancy vintage 
wines. She picks several out and gives them to Ki-Tek. 
Ki-Tek’s face grows dark as he follows Yon-Kyo with the heavy 
basket.
EXT. MANSION - GARDEN - MORNING 
Chung-Sook is setting up the tables in the ‘Crane Formation’ 
around the tent. Da-Song is still sleeping inside. She is 
sweating and grunting away by herself when she sees -- 
A pajama-clad Dong-Ik walking toward the tent. He smiles 
awkwardly at Chung-Sook before checking inside the tent. He 
turns to Chung-Sook and puts a finger on his lips -- ‘Shhhh.’
DONG-IK
(silent)
He’s still sleeping.
Chung-Sook nods and proceeds quietly. It’s hard to set up the 
bulky tables without making noise. 
Dong-Ik scratches his belly as he returns to the house. 
INT. MERCEDES - DRIVING - MORNING 
YON-KYO
(into the phone)
Did you see the sky today? 
Crystal clear. Zero air 
pollution. Rain washed it all 
away. Of course camping was a 
major fail because of the rain, 
but we get to have a garden party 
instead, yay! It was actually a 
blessing in disguise. 
117. 123 123
124 124
Yon-Kyo is jabbering away when she suddenly smells something 
and holds her nose. Ki-Tek’s scent must have drifted her way. 
Ki-Tek sees Yon-Kyo covering her nose through the rearview 
mirror. It bothers him. 
Yon-Kyo rolls down the window slightly. 
YON-KYO (CONT’D)
I almost forgot. Please please 
please don’t bring any presents. 
You have to promise. 
EXT. MANSION - GARDEN - DAY 
The sun shines brightly on the garden. PARTY GUESTS sit around 
tables decorated with flowers. Chung-Sook busily shuttles food 
from the kitchen. 
Some of the Guests have already finished the bottles of wine at 
their table. People are having a good time.
INT. MANSION - DA-HAE’S ROOM - DAY 
We see the party downstairs through Da-Hae’s window. Colorful 
GIFT BOXES are stacked high in front of Da-Song’s teepee. 
Ki-Woo looks out the window with a blank expression. Da-Hae 
stands beside him, staring. 
DA-HAE
You were somewhere else, weren’t 
you?
KI-WOO
What?
DA-HAE
When we were kissing just now. 
You were somewhere else. Right?
KI-WOO
No...
DA-HAE
Stop lying. You’re still thinking 
about something else. 
Ki-Woo sees the crowd mingling effortlessly in the garden -- 
118. A KID taking pictures with his Leica, a WOMAN passionately 
explaining something to other Guests with a bottle of wine in 
her hand, a MALE GUEST chopping firewood next to the grill and 
looking utterly cool doing it. Everyone looks genuinely happy. 
KI-WOO
(re: Guests)
They’re all so gorgeous. Even 
though they had to come at the 
last minute. So cool. Laid back. 
Da-Hae looks puzzled. 
KI-WOO (CONT’D)
Da-Hae.
DA-HAE
Yeah?
KI-WOO
Do I look like I belong here?
DA-HAE
What do you mean?
KI-WOO
Do I look like I belong in this 
house?
Da-Hae has no idea why he’s asking. 
Ki-Woo, still numb, pads over to the desk where his bag is. 
DA-HAE
Where are you going?
KI-WOO
I need to go downstairs.
DA-HAE
Stay. Let’s hang out.
KI-WOO
I need to go down. 
DA-HAE
Those people are boring.
Da-Hae hugs Ki-Woo tightly. 
DA-HAE (CONT’D)
Just stay with me. 
KI-WOO
(sotto)
Not there. Further down. 
119. 125 125
With a grim face, Ki-Woo removes the suiseki from his bag. 
DA-HAE
Whoa. What is that thing? 
EXT. MANSION - GARDEN - DAY 
Dong-Ik and Ki-Tek hide behind the trees where the Guests can’t 
see them, dressed as NATIVE AMERICANS. 
Dong-Ik puts feathers and other finishing touches on Ki-Tek’s 
costume. 
DONG-IK
I can’t believe we’re doing this. 
Look at us. A couple of middleaged men, wearing silly costumes-- 
KI-TEK
It’s fine... 
Dong-Ik and Ki-Tek both laugh awkwardly. 
Ki-Tek looks exhausted. It’s been a nonstop shitshow since 
yesterday -- the flood, the evacuation center, spending the 
morning as Yon-Kyo’s shopping assistant, and now the elaborate 
role-playing. He just stands there, limply holding the toy 
axe. 
DONG-IK
I’m really sorry, Mr. Kim. Mrs. 
Park made me do this. I didn’t 
have a choice. 
(then)
It’s really simple. There’s going 
to be a cake ceremony, and 
Jessica, the art teacher, is going 
to bring out the cake. She’s 
walking, walking, walking, she’s 
going to present the cake-- Then 
we appear from the trees swinging 
our axes, ambushing her! Because, 
you know, we’re the bad guys. 
KI-TEK
Sure.
DONG-IK
At that moment, Da-Song, the good 
Indian, attacks us with his axe. 
A battle ensues, and Da-Song 
heroically saves Ms. Jessica and 
the cake! Everybody applauds. 
You get the idea. I know it’s 
ridiculous. 
120. Dong-Ik laughs again. 
KI-TEK
I guess Mrs. Park enjoys throwing 
parties. 
DONG-IK
I suppose she does. She put a lot 
of effort into Da-Song’s birthday 
this year. 
KI-TEK
How thoughtful of her. And you 
too. 
Dong-Ik senses a tone in Ki-Tek’s voice. 
KI-TEK (CONT’D)
What can you do, I guess. You 
love them, right? 
Ki-Tek doesn’t hide the sarcasm, and Dong-Ik notices. Tension 
rises between them. 
DONG-IK
Mr. Kim, you’re technically 
working today, aren’t you?
KI-TEK
Yes, sir.
DONG-IK
Then just think of this as part of 
the job. 
Dong-Ik avoids Ki-Tek’s eyes as he puts another feather on KiTek’s headband. 
KI-TEK
Mr. Park. I think you went over 
the line.
DONG-IK
What did you say?
KI-TEK
No. I mean this. 
Dong-Ik sees that one of the feathers was pushed too far. The 
tip is poking out from the bottom of the headband. He still 
can’t shake the feeling that Ki-Tek was talking about a 
different ‘line.’ 
Ki-Tek pushes up the errant feather with his finger. 
121. 126 INT. MANSION - KITCHEN 126
Chung-Sook sets up the buffet table according to Yon-Kyo’s 
reference picture. 
A FOREIGN CHEF is behind her marinating barbecue meat. When he 
finishes and takes the meat out to the garden -- 
Ki-Jung carefully approaches Chung-Sook. 
KI-JUNG
(whispering)
Have you been down there?
CHUNG-SOOK
No, I’ve been too busy.
KI-JUNG
Shouldn’t we try to talk to them? 
Try to reach an agreement. 
CHUNG-SOOK
I think so too. We all got too 
emotional yesterday. 
Ki-Jung looks around before saying -- 
KI-JUNG
I’ll go down there and see how 
they’re doing. 
Chung-Sook nods. From under the table, she takes out a LARGE 
PARTY PLATTER filled with various foods. 
CHUNG-SOOK
Here. Take this with you. I made 
it for them just in case. They’ll 
be more willing to talk if their 
stomachs are full. 
Ki-Jung nods. She takes the platter and adds a few more 
meatballs from the buffet table. She is about to go down to 
the basement when -- 
She hears Yon-Kyo’s high-pitched laughter coming from the 
living room. 
YON-KYO (O.S.)
Jessica! I was looking for you! 
What are you doing there? Come 
out here. 
Ki-Jung slowly puts the platter down behind her. 
122. 127 127
128 128
Chung-Sook quickly escapes, taking more food out to the garden. 
Yon-Kyo comes in and pulls Ki-Jung out to the -- 
LIVING ROOM
Where she shows Ki-Jung a GOURMET CREAM CAKE sitting on the 
coffee table. 
YON-KYO (CONT’D)
This cake is very symbolic. It 
has a therapeutic significance, 
you know, related to Da-Song’s 
trauma. I want you to bring it 
out, Jessica. It has to be you. 
It’ll be the highlight of the day! 
As Yon-Kyo and Ki-Jung admire the cake -- 
We see Ki-Woo quietly walking down the stairs, out of focus in 
the background. He has the GRAY BAG over his shoulder. He 
enters the kitchen and walks down to the storage basement. 
INT. MANSION - STORAGE BASEMENT - DAY 
Ki-Woo pushes the jar cabinet to the side, revealing the dark 
steel door behind it. He unties the tightly wrapped wires and 
opens the door. He walks down one step at a time, holding up 
his cell phone flashlight. 
INT. MANSION - SECRET ROOM - DAY 
The room is pitch black. Once he reaches the bottom of the 
stairs, Ki-Woo removes the viewing stone from the gray bag. 
His hands tremble, and he starts breathing faster. With his 
cell phone flashlight tucked in his breast pocket, he carefully 
makes his way in, eventually finding -- 
A tied-up Mun-Kwang fallen next to the toilet. 
Ki-Woo swallows nervously. His legs grow weak and his eyes 
brim with tears as he slowly walks up to Mun-Kwang’s head. 
He raises the stone to strike Mun-Kwang but -- 
He can’t do it. 
He just stands there, face covered in snot and tears, shaking 
uncontrollably, when -- 
We notice a CIRCULAR OBJECT ‘floating’ behind Ki-Woo. A NOOSE. 
Kun-Sae has untied his cord and formed a noose with it. He 
slowly brings it above Ki-Woo’s head. 
123. 129 129
130 130
Ki-Woo is oblivious. He continues to sob and shudder. He 
finally feels something behind him and looks up but -- 
Too late. Kun-Sae quickly wraps the noose around Ki-Woo’s neck 
and tightens it! Ki-Woo struggles. The viewing stone drops 
and hits his foot, which causes him to further lose his 
balance. He is dragged across the floor by Kun-Sae. 
We can only see Kun-Sae’s maniacal eyes in the darkness as he 
strangles Ki-Woo. 
Ki-Woo thrashes violently. He can’t breathe and his eyes are 
ready to roll back. 
Kun-Sae picks up the viewing stone and raises it to deliver the 
final blow. He swings it mightily at Ki-Woo’s head, but -- 
Ki-Woo turns and avoids it at the last moment. Ki-Woo runs up 
the stairs, cord still dangling from his neck. 
Kun-Sae chases Ki-Woo with the stone. 
Ki-Woo has just made it past the jar cabinet when --
Kun-Sae grabs the cord dragging behind Ki-Woo and pulls it 
hard. Ki-Woo flies backward into the air and -- 
SLAM! -- Falls hard on the floor. His wind is knocked out.
Kun-Sae runs up to Ki-Woo. He raises the stone high and brings 
it down on Ki-Woo’s head! We hear a horrifying crunch as we -- 
SMASH TO:
EXT. MANSION - GARDEN - DAY 
We hear applause. One of the Party Guests, an OPERA SINGER, 
starts singing an aria.
Ki-Jung is holding the cake. Yon-Kyo lights the candles.
INT. MANSION - STORAGE BASEMENT - DAY 
A thirsty Kun-Sae gulps down a large bottle of plum extract. 
He pushes the cabinet back in place and hides the secret 
doorway. 
He hears the faint sound of aria coming from above. When he 
turns, we finally see his face -- 
It’s horrible. And a little ridiculous. Blood from his 
forehead has dried into a frightening red mask. But a clear 
rectangle remains where the tape covered his mouth. 
124. 131 131
132 132
Kun-Sae looks down at his feet where Ki-Woo is lying. Blood is 
slowly pooling around Ki-Woo’s head, pushing out the puddles of 
plum extract spilled on the floor. 
Kun-Sae picks up the viewing stone from the floor and slams KiWoo’s head again! Ki-Woo’s fingers tremble. Is he still 
conscious? Or was that the last flicker of life... 
INT. MANSION - KITCHEN - DAY 
Kun-Sae trudges up the stairs and arrives in the bright 
kitchen. A surreal juxtaposition. His ghostly, blood-smeared 
mask against the pure white kitchen. Out in the garden he 
sees, through laughing and applauding party guests -- 
Ki-Jung, holding Da-Song’s birthday cake. 
Kun-Sae picks up a large kitchen knife from the sink and walks 
toward the garden. As soon as he disappears --
Da-Hae comes down the stairs and pokes her head inside the 
kitchen.
DA-HAE
Kevin! Kevin, where are you?
EXT. MANSION - GARDEN - DAY 
Ki-Jung walks down the ‘aisle’ between the Party Guests, slowly 
so the candles don’t blow out. 
An embarrassed but obviously excited Da-Song waits in front of 
the tent. He watches his favorite teacher Ms. Jessica bringing 
him the cake when --
Everyone SCREAMS, and the crowd parts like the Red Sea.
Ki-Jung looks back to see -- 
Kun-Sae running toward her with the kitchen knife. 
Ki-Jung shoves the cake in Kun-Sae’s face just as he swings the 
knife. But a beat too late as the knife plunges into her 
chest. 
Kun-Sae pulls the knife, and blood plumes from Ki-Jung’s chest. 
It sprays over the white cream covering exactly half of KunSae’s face. 
When Ki-Jung falls, Da-Song sees Kun-Sae looming over him, 
dripping with Jessica’s blood. The ghost. 
125. Da-Song screams. A truly horrible scream. Louder and two 
octaves higher than the Guests. His eyes roll back, and he 
goes into a full-on seizure. We hear Yon-Kyo’s scream from 
somewhere in the crowd. 
Kun-Sae pulls up Ki-Jung and puts the knife to her throat. He 
shouts to the Guests -- 
KUN-SAE
Don’t move!
Ki-Tek and Dong-Ik are running out from the trees when they 
stop at Kun-Sae’s voice. The chaotically fleeing Guests also 
freeze in their tracks.
A tense moment. A WHITE BUTTERFLY flies over to Kun-Sae and 
flutters its wings above his cake-covered head. 
KUN-SAE (CONT’D)
Chung-Sook! Where are you! Come 
out you fucking bitch!
Chung-Sook emerges from behind the crowd. Her eyes are set on 
Ki-Jung. 
CHUNG-SOOK
Ki-Jung! Wake up!
Ki-Jung is bleeding profusely. She lets out a weak moan. 
CHUNG-SOOK (CONT’D)
(screaming)
Put pressure on the wound, KiJung! You have to stop the blood! 
Chung-Sook and Ki-Tek are focused on Ki-Jung while Dong-Ik and 
Yon-Kyo can’t look away from Da-Song. An agonizing moment for 
both families. No one moves until -- 
Kun-Sae throws Ki-Jung on the ground and makes a dash for 
Chung-Sook. People scream, scatter. 
Chung-Sook turns the grill over, spilling charred meat and 
firewood over Kun-Sae. Smoke creates a temporary screen. 
When Kun-Sae comes through the smoke, Chung-Sook quickly 
snatches his wrist, pulling him into a vicious fight. 
Ki-Tek heaves his toy axe at Kun-Sae as he runs toward the 
fight. It misses Kun-Sae and instead bounces off Chung-Sook’s 
head. 
Meanwhile Dong-Ik jumps over the wounded Ki-Jung and sprints 
toward Da-Song. He picks up the spasming child and runs back 
through the crowd toward Yon-Kyo.
126. Chung-Sook and Kun-Sae go at each other in the middle of the 
garden like two predators. Ki-Tek comes to help but can’t find 
a way to squeeze between them. 
He goes to Ki-Jung and tries to stanch the blood. It won’t 
stop. He looks for something to tie her with, but there’s 
nothing around. Everyone is busy fleeing, and no one stops to 
help. 
KI-TEK
Help! Please help us! 
Dong-Ik gives Da-Song to Yon-Kyo, who barks furiously at KiTek. 
YON-KYO
Mr. Kim, get the car! We can’t 
wait for an ambulance!
DONG-IK
Kim! Get the car!
YON-KYO
Fifteen minutes! 
Dong-Ik and Yon-Kyo scream frantically at Ki-Tek as he 
desperately tries to stop the blood from Ki-Jung’s wound. 
Yon-Kyo has a crazed look. Her maternal instinct has been 
kicked up to 11. She doesn’t care that Ki-Jung is dying or 
that two deranged people are fighting in her garden. 
Dong-Ik can’t wait anymore. He yells at Ki-Tek.
DONG-IK
Keys! Give me the keys!
At that moment -- 
We see the hell breaking loose in the garden in SLOW MOTION. 
Party Guests continue to escape one by one, and only the 
‘little people’ are left viciously fighting for their lives. 
KI-TEK’S POV --
He sees his daughter’s blood dripping between his fingers... 
His wife flailing under a man with a knife... Dong-Ik and YonKyo yelling at him... Party Guests running away...
To add to the list of completely fucked-up shit, he sees -- 
Da-Hae walking toward the gate with a bloody and unconscious 
Ki-Woo on her back. Bawling her eyes out. 
127. Meanwhile Dong-Ik continues to yell at Ki-Tek --
DONG-IK (CONT’D)
The keys!
Ki-Tek removes the car keys from his pocket and hastily throws 
them at Dong-Ik. They hit one of the fleeing guests and drop 
in the grass. 
Kun-Sae and Chung-Sook roll over the keys as they continue 
their death match. Kun-Sae picks up the fallen kitchen knife 
and stabs Chung-Sook in the arm! 
Chung-Sook grabs her arm as she falls into a pile of burning 
logs behind her. She screams. 
Kun-Sae is not done. He climbs on top of her and raises the 
knife to finish her off. 
Ki-Tek jumps at Kun-Sae to stop him, but Kun-Sae is too strong. 
His rage has endowed him with supernatural strength. He 
quickly subdues Ki-Tek and brings the knife up to stab him.
Ki-Tek closes his eyes. He braces himself for the final moment 
when --
Nothing happens? Ki-Tek slowly opens his eyes. He sees --
A METAL BARBECUE SKEWER deeply plunged into Kun-Sae’s waist. 
Kun-Sae can’t even scream. The pain of the hot skewer piercing 
his innards is too much. 
We see Chung-Sook holding the other end. In between we see 
pieces of meat and sausage smoking on the skewer. As ChungSook lets go -- 
Kun-Sae gradually crumbles to the ground. 
Ki-Tek’s crazed, red eyes see Dong-Ik running toward him. 
Dong-Ik lifts Chung-Sook and searches underneath for the car 
keys. No longer the cool, poised CEO. He’s overcome with 
fear, panic. He rolls over Kun-Sae and finally locates the 
keys when --
He smells something and frowns. It’s Kun-Sae’s body odor. He 
holds his nose at the awful smell. 
Ki-Tek notices. A fleeting moment, but it triggers something 
inside him. Ki-Tek picks up the TOY AXE from the ground and 
stalks Dong-Ik. 
When Dong-Ik hears Ki-Tek’s footsteps and turns around -- 
128. 133 133
Ki-Tek swings the axe and plants it right between Dong-Ik’s 
neck and shoulder! 
That’s when we realize -- it’s not a toy. It’s a REAL AXE. 
The one the cool guy used to chop firewood for the barbecue. 
We’re not sure if Ki-Tek knew it. It doesn’t matter. All that 
matters is that it’s stuck deeply in Dong-Ik’s neck. 
Yon-Kyo and the Party Guests are too stunned to scream. 
Blood spurts from Dong-Ik’s neck as he falls on the grass.
Ki-Tek stares blankly at Dong-Ik. He feels something touch his 
foot and looks down -- 
It’s Da-Song’s toy axe. The real axe is still in his hands, 
dripping with Dong-Ik’s blood. 
Yon-Kyo faints with Da-Song in her arms. Everyone in the 
garden stops and stares at Ki-Tek, the axe murderer, in horror. 
Ki-Tek wakes up from his daze and realizes what he’s done. 
He’s horrified. He bolts for the gate. When frightened Guests 
jump out of his way, he realizes that he still has the bloody 
axe. He throws it away. 
Ki-Tek is scared. As he runs to the gate, he sees -- 
-- Chung-Sook pressing down Ki-Jung’s chest while fighting 
through her own pain. The Foreign Chef is beside her bandaging 
her arm. 
-- Kun-Sae, bleeding out from his punctured waist, alone and 
neglected by the crowd. 
-- A FEW MEN trying to stanch Dong-Ik’s blood while calling 
911. 
-- WOMEN helping up Yon-Kyo and Da-Song. 
Ki-Tek leaves the chaos behind and runs out of the gate. As 
SIRENS grow louder in the distance, we -- 
FADE TO BLACK.
INT. DARK VOID 
The screen is pitch black. We start hearing faint sounds 
before slowly FADING IN on -- 
A MAN staring into the CAMERA. 
KI-WOO (V.O.)
He was the first person I saw when 
I woke up a month later.
129. 134 134
135 135
We realize this is KI-WOO’S POV. He narrates in a calm voice.
The Man has a nondescript face and narrow shoulders. He is 
talking, but we can’t hear anything. 
KI-WOO (V.O.)
A detective. Although he didn’t 
look like one. 
When we focus on the Man’s mouth, we can sort of read his lips 
-- 
“You have the right to remain silent...”
The Man seems to be reading Ki-Woo his Miranda Rights. 
REVEAL -- Ki-Woo lying on the bed, his head heavily bandaged. 
He flashes a languid smile, his eyes droopy. 
KI-WOO (V.O.)
Then I saw a doctor who didn’t 
look like a doctor. He told me 
one of the side effects of brain 
surgery was laughing for no 
reason. 
A QUIRKY-LOOKING DOCTOR examines Ki-Woo’s pupils. 
Everything seems like a dream to Ki-Woo, whose left eye is 
slightly crossed, possibly as a result of nerve damage during 
surgery. 
INT. PRISON HOSPITAL WARD - HALLWAY - DAY 
KI-WOO (V.O.)
Maybe that’s why I laughed when I 
heard that Ki-Jung died. They 
said she died from loss of blood. 
Ki-Woo chuckles and grabs his stomach as he pushes an IV pole 
down the hall. 
The GUARDS look at him strangely. 
INT. COURT - DAY 
KI-WOO (V.O.)
I also laughed when Mom and I 
received our sentences. We 
avoided the slew of charges they 
threw at us -- forgery, home 
invasion, voluntary manslaughter, 
which we argued was self defense 
-- and walked away with probation.
130. 136 136
137 137
138 138
Ki-Woo can’t stop giggling as the JUDGE hands down his 
sentence. Chung-Sook and his LAWYER give him a look. 
INT. BUS - DRIVING - DAY 
Chung-Sook and Ki-Woo bounce in their seats as the bus speeds 
away from the city. They look out at the sunny view. 
KI-WOO (V.O.)
Same when I saw Ki-Jung again for 
the first time since the incident. 
INT. CINERARIUM - DAY 
Countless WHITE URNS line the shelves. We see Ki-Jung’s 
picture on one of them. 
KI-WOO (V.O.)
I laughed then too. 
Ki-Woo is in front of Ki-Jung’s urn. He stares at his sister’s 
brightly smiling face in the picture. He smiles back. 
Chung-Sook is sobbing behind him. 
The picture must be a few years old. Ki-Jung is brighter, 
happier in it. More innocent. 
INT. SEMI-BASEMENT - KI-JUNG’S ROOM - DAY 
Everything is just as Ki-Jung left it. Chung-Sook is on the 
floor scrubbing the remaining mud stains off the furniture. 
The CAMERA soon leaves her and moves to the --
BATHROOM 
Where Ki-Woo is sitting on the toilet. He’s watching a monthold news clip on his phone. 
A REPORTER is in the news studio talking about the Park house 
incident.
REPORTER 1 (NEWS)
The murders, which had no apparent 
motive and took place in a quiet, 
upper-class neighborhood, have 
confounded the police. The other 
suspect, an unidentified homeless 
male, was murdered himself at the 
scene, further shrouding-- 
Ki-Woo flips to another news clip. Another REPORTER appears. 
131. 139 139
140 140
REPORTER 2 (NEWS)
The driver, Kim, was known to have 
a good relationship with his 
employer Park, and police have yet 
to narrow down a concrete motive. 
Kim**’s whereabouts are still 
unclear after he was last seen 
fleeing the scene, and police 
continue searching for leads. His 
cell signal was last active at the 
crime scene-- 
EXT. RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD - ALLEY - DAY 
KI-WOO (V.O.)
Of course neither Mom or I have 
had any contact with you since 
that day. 
Ki-Woo is going around different apartments, posting 
promotional flyers. His new job. 
We see the DETECTIVE from the hospital following him from afar. 
The Detective is watching Ki-Woo from a staircase when he 
twists his ankle and falls down the steps. 
Ki-Woo sees the Detective fall. He feels bad for the guy. 
KI-WOO (V.O.)
I just feel awful those poor 
detectives who have to follow us 
all day. 
EXT. HILL - LATE AFTERNOON 
It’s winter now. Ki-Woo, bundled in a parka, climbs a hill in 
the middle of Seoul, walking through gray, leafless trees. His 
breath mists in the air. 
KI-WOO (V.O.)
I did have a strong feeling about 
where you might be.
When he’s climbed high enough, Ki-Woo plops down on a rock. He 
removes a large TELESCOPE from his bag. 
KI-WOO (V.O.)
So when the season changed and the 
news slowed down -- and when the 
detectives finally stopped 
trailing us -- I started climbing 
the mountain.
132. 141 141
TELESCOPE POV -- 
We see the magnified view of the Park mansion and the garden. 
KI-WOO (V.O.)
You can see the house pretty well 
from there. 
Through the living room window, we see a family laughing and 
talking. Not the Parks. A CAUCASIAN FAMILY. From the image 
of the happy foreign family,
DISSOLVE TO -- 
Ki-Woo shivering in the cold, still looking through the 
telescope. It’s dark now. 
KI-WOO (V.O.)
I don’t know why, but that day I 
just felt like staying longer. 
TELESCOPE POV -- 
The family members have gone to their rooms to sleep, and the 
living room is empty. There’s no movement until -- 
The ‘MOTION-SENSOR’ LIGHTS in the entrance start blinking. It 
blinks at varied intervals. Long then short. Short then long. 
We see Ki-Woo’s eye grow wide through the telescope lens. 
He studies the timing of the blinks, which don’t seem 
completely random. There’s a pattern. Could it be Morse code? 
Ki-Woo starts recording into his cell phone -- 
KI-WOO
Dash. Dot. Dash-dash-- 
Wind howls as Ki-Woo continues to rattle off dots and dashes 
with a trembling voice.
INT. SUBWAY CAR - MOVING - NIGHT 
Ki-Woo is on the last train of the night, listening to the 
recording he made earlier through his earphones. 
He uses a permanent marker to transcribe the dots and dashes on 
a paper prescription bag. When he runs out of room, he writes 
on his flyers. When he runs out of room there, he starts 
writing on his jeans. 
The WOMAN sitting next to him looks at him like he’s a crazy 
person. 
133. 142 142
143 143
Ki-Woo opens a MORSE CODE CHART on his cell phone. He stops 
the playback. He starts deciphering the codes. Dots and 
dashes soon become words -- 
“Dear Son...”
INT. MANSION - SECRET ROOM - NIGHT 
And the words turn into Ki-Tek’s VOICE-OVER --
KI-TEK (V.O.)
Dear Son. Perhaps you, if no one 
else, will be able to read this 
letter--
We see Ki-Tek sitting at a desk in the dark chamber. On the 
desk is a densely written letter, which he’s translating into 
Morse code. He consults a faded MORSE CODE CHART that Kun-Sae 
put up above the desk. 
KI-TEK (V.O.)
You were a Boy Scout so I’m hoping 
this will somehow reach you.
Ki-Tek looks thinner and has grown a full beard. He writes 
thoughtfully one word at a time. 
KI-TEK (V.O.)
How is your health? Your mother 
I’m not too worried about. I’m 
sure she’s healthy as an ox. 
(then)
I’m doing well too. Although I 
cry often when I think of Ki-Jung. 
EXT. MANSION - GARDEN - DAY (KI-TEK’S FLASHBACK) 
Images from the fateful day appear in flashes -- 
Blood spurting from Ki-Jung**’s chest... Kun-Sae’s face 
covered in cake and blood... The axe silently coming down on 
Dong-Ik’s shoulder... Ki-Tek’s hand gripping the bloody axe... 
KI-TEK (V.O.)
I still can’t believe what 
happened that day. It almost 
feels like a dream. 
Then we switch to Ki-Tek’s running POV**... People screaming, 
running away... The gate approaching ahead... 
KI-TEK (V.O.)
I knew, as soon as I ran out of 
that gate, where I had to go.

EXT. MANSION - GATE - DAY (KI-TEK’S FLASHBACK) 
SLOW MOTION of Ki-Tek running down the stairs in front of the 
gate. He sees -- 
The front of a MINI COOPER jutting out of the half-open garage. 
They were able to squeeze the car in but not able to fully 
close the door. 
Ki-Tek ducks through the opening and enters the garage. 
A few Party Guests roam the street in panic, but they’re too 
stricken with terror to notice. 
Only the nonfunctional surveillance camera looks down at Ki-Tek 
as he slips through the door. 
INT. MANSION - LIVING ROOM - DAY (KI-TEK’S FLASHBACK) 
Ki-Tek pokes his head out from the garage stairs and looks 
inside the living room. It’s empty. Through the window he 
sees terrified Party Guests stampeding toward the sound of the 
ambulance. 
Holding his shoes in his hands, Ki-Tek quickly crosses to the 
kitchen and rushes down to the storage basement. 
INT. MANSION - STORAGE BASEMENT - DAY (KI-TEK’S 
FLASHBACK) 
KI-TEK (V.O.)
Even in the complete madness, I 
had the foresight to grab some 
water and food--
Ki-Tek picks up a box of CANNED TUNA and a box of EVIAN. He 
takes care to avoid the blood and plum extract on the floor as 
he walks across the basement. 
He pushes the jar cabinet to the side and opens the steel door 
behind it. He steps inside and closes the door. 
As he turns the crank handle and seals himself inside the 
darkness -- 
FADE TO BLACK. 
INT. MANSION - VARIOUS - NIGHT 
When we fade back in, we see an emptied-out mansion lit only by 
moonlight. The Parks have moved out. 
135. 148 148
149 149
KI-TEK (V.O.)
I realized only later that a house 
with such a morbid history would 
not be appealing to potential 
buyers. I would have to stay in 
an empty house for a long time. 
We go from room to room until we arrive in the --
SECRET ROOM 
Ki-Tek picks at a can of tuna using Kun-Sae’s fork. He eats 
one tiny piece at a time, conserving what limited food he has. 
All the while he stares across the room where, in the darkness 
-- 
MUN-KWANG is curled up next to the toilet. 
EXT. MANSION - GARDEN - NIGHT 
KI-TEK (V.O.)
One good thing about being alone 
was that I was finally able to 
give her a proper funeral. 
Mun-Kwang’s hefty body is thrown into a dirt hole.
We see Ki-Tek panting at the mouth of the hole, exhausted from 
moving her all the way from the basement. The hole is dug in 
front of a large tree.
One scoop at a time, dirt is scattered over Mun-Kwang’s face. 
Ki-Tek stops shoveling and takes a break. He leans on the tree 
and looks up at the stars twinkling above. 
KI-TEK (V.O.)
Tree burials are all the rage 
these days, so I guess no one can 
say I didn’t give her a proper 
farewell. 
INT. MANSION - SECRET ROOM - DAY 
Ki-Tek is sitting with his eyes closed in front of Dong-Ik’s 
picture that Kun-Sae put up on the wall. Head bowed. 
Penitent. A bit comical, but he doesn’t care. He continues to 
solemnly pay his respects when --
He hears a faint sound coming from above. He walks up the 
stairs and puts his ear on the steel door. 
136. 150 150
He hears lively chatter on the other side. Someone’s come to 
see the house. They speak German. 
KI-TEK (V.O.)
The real estate agents were 
smarter than I thought. They 
somehow managed to sell the house 
to a family that just moved to 
Korea. 
INT. MANSION - KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING 
It’s dark, and everyone is still asleep. Except Ki-Taek, who 
walks up to the kitchen and quietly crawls over to the 
refrigerator. 
He sees a FAMILY PORTRAIT hanging on the kitchen wall. A 
GERMAN FAMILY OF FOUR, white teeth shining brightly through 
their broad smiles. There are more pictures on the 
refrigerator. One picture shows a FILIPINO MAID with her arms 
around the family’s kids. 
KI-TEK (V.O.)
The parents both work, and the 
kids are at school most of the 
day, which should have made them 
ideal housemates for me. But 
unfortunately they have a live-in 
maid, and I risk my life every 
night for the tiny window of 
opportunity I have to venture 
outside. 
Ki-Tek carefully opens the fridge, and a cool shaft of light 
hits his face. Inside we see -- 
Tofu, sausage, Korean gochujang paste, Japanese natto beans... 
KI-TEK (V.O.)
Luckily, Germans don’t only eat 
German food. I thought I would 
have to eat sausage and beer for 
the rest of my life. 
Ki-Tek takes a little of each food and puts them in Kun-Sae’s 
old plastic container when, through his peripheral vision, he 
sees -- 
Something moving in the garden! 
Ki-Tek nearly jumps out of his skin. He quickly turns only to 
realize -- 
137. 151 151
152 152
153 153
It was his own reflection in the living room window. He stares 
at the pale ghost for a long moment. 
INT. MANSION - SECRET ROOM 
-- Ki-Tek eats tofu in the dark corner. Above the long beard, 
we see his dull, soulless eyes. 
KI-TEK (V.O.)
When you’re in here, you lose your 
sense of reality. 
-- Ki-Tek lies motionless on Kun-Sae’s cot. His breathing is 
so faint that we almost can’t tell he’s alive. 
KI-TEK (V.O.)
But today was a good day. I wrote 
this letter to you. 
-- Ki-Tek gets up and walks over to the light switches. 
Looking at his Morse-code-coverted letter, he starts turning 
the switches on and off. As he sends his coded message to the 
outside world, we very slowly -- 
FADE TO BLACK. 
KI-TEK (V.O.)
Take care, Son. 
EXT. KI-WOO’S NEIGHBORHOOD - ALLEY - EARLY MORNING 
Ki-Woo runs as fast as he can through the alley, chest bursting 
with excitement. His breath creates a trail of mist as he 
passes the lights of nearby semi-basement apartments. 
INT. SEMI-BASEMENT - LIVING ROOM - EARLY MORNING 
An out-of-breath Ki-Woo runs into the apartment and immediately 
picks up a used piece of paper. He doesn’t even bother to take 
his coat off. 
He sits at the kitchen table and starts writing furiously. 
As CAMERA TRACKS IN on his quickly moving hand -- 
Begin SENTIMENTAL MUSIC.

155 155
156 156
157 157
158 158
INT. SEMI-BASEMENT - EARLY MORNING 
We MOVE IN on Ki-Woo’s sleeping face. He looks happy. Tightly 
held in his hand is the letter he just wrote. 
His eyelids flutter lightly. He must be dreaming. 
We hear KI-WOO’S VOICE reading the letter -- 
KI-WOO (V.O.)
Father. Today I made a plan. 
EXT. STREAM - DAY 
We witness the moment when the VIEWING STONE was first 
discovered. A PAIR OF HANDS pick up the rock from a beautiful, 
pristine stream. 
KI-WOO (V.O.)
A long-term plan.
EXT. RICH NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY 
Ki-Woo walks up the hill of the wealthy neighborhood. He’s 
older. Dressed in a nice suit and tie. 
KI-WOO (V.O.)
I’m going to make a lot of money. 
EXT. MANSION GATE - DAY 
Ki-Woo is at the mansion. The one that at different points 
belonged to the Parks, the German family, and Namgoong Hyunja. 
He walks up to the gate with a few REAL ESTATE AGENTS. 
KI-WOO (V.O.)
First I’ll need to go to college. 
Then I’ll get a job and get 
married. But ultimately, I want 
to get rich. 
EXT. MANSION - GARDEN - DAY 
-- A FEMALE REAL ESTATE AGENT shows Ki-Woo the garden. Ki-Woo 
stands in the sunlight and looks up at the majestic trees. 
KI-WOO (V.O.)
And when I get rich, I will buy 
this house. 
139. 159 159
-- As PROFESSIONAL MOVERS carry boxes into the house, two 
people step into the living room --
Ki-Woo and Chung-Sook. 
Outside the window, we see a WOMAN and a GIRL -- Ki-Woo’s wife 
and daughter? -- playing in the garden. 
KI-WOO (V.O.)
We’ll pick a sunny day to move in. 
-- Everything has been unpacked and put in place. The Movers 
leave, and only Ki-Woo and his family remain. 
They are enjoying the sun at the patio table. Ki-Woo turns 
toward the house.
 KI-WOO (V.O.)
Then all you have to do is walk up 
the stairs. 
He’s looking at the kitchen. Late afternoon rays lean into it 
at a low angle. We hear FOOTSTEPS coming from the basement 
stairs. 
CAMERA MOVES IN, and we see a faint glimpse of someone coming 
up the stairs. Ki-Tek? 
KI-WOO
Come out, Dad.
Then at last --
Ki-Tek walks out into the bright garden. Buckets of sunlight 
wash away years of darkness. He hugs his family. An emotional 
reunion. 
As SENTIMENTAL MUSIC swells into a climax -- 
SMASH TO:
EXT. HILL - LATE EVENING 
Cold. Windy. The sun is dropping fast. Ki-Woo is on the 
mountain again looking through the telescope.
He puts it down and looks into the distance. 
KI-WOO (V.O.)
But I have a problem, Father -- I 
have no idea how to get this 
letter to you. 
140. We see the Park mansion far away. Surrounded by countless 
other mansions. Lights turn on and off across the 
neighborhood. It’s as if the houses are trying to talk to us. 
Ki-Woo’s nose is bright red from the cold. His eyes brim with 
tears. 
Sharp wind cuts up his breath as soon as it mists in the air. 
As the wind continues to howl -- 
FADE TO BLACK.
OVER BLACK -- 
MUSIC plays. Bright, but with an undertone of hopelessness.
The End
