?.EV. 3-14-83
OPEN ON:
A black screen at the lower left hand corner of which
shines a small clown's face. It is barely noticeable
as we BEGIN TITLES.
l
The music is bright but not so full that we don't
discern with ever increasing awareness the off-screen
voices of a man and a woman, AURORA and RUDYARD GREENWAY.
We hear the downstairs front door close as AURORA arrives
home and shouts upstairs to ·her husband. "Rudyard, I'm home. Those women always talks about the same thi~gs. I'm sorry I ever left Boston.• He says, "Did you have
a good time?" "How could I? I had a premonition
something happened to the baby.• He makes a sound.
He's heard this before. "She's fine. You've qot to
stop imaga.nging something's wrong with her all 0
the '::i:ne."
The door at screen riaht opens and we now can recognize from the light flowing in from the hall that we are in
a baby's room--the clown's face a small night light. The infant is in a hand-worked, excellent and therefore
memorable crib. AURORA'S back is to the camera--her
rear end a large one, perhaps t~~pting to some--and her
back-lit outline is round and cushy. And now she t~rns
toward the room and is facing the camera, still
illuminated from behind--the mother's form we may all remember framed in the doorways of our rooms as we lay helpless and needina. AURORA stands still for a beat
and then says her first on-screen words.
AURORA
I know, I know; you're right. (then with eerie cal:nl
Rudyard, she's not breathing.
RUDYA;l.O
Let's not go through this again.
She's asleep.
The lump under the pink blanket behi~d the light wooden
bars of the crib is not budging. She leans bacl<::,1ards to
call down the hall.
AURORA
No, no, it's crib death.
RUDYARD'S VO!CZ
(annoyed) Aurora, it's just that she
hasn't slept today.

She pads quietly to her infant daughter's bed and coos

AURORA

E:.~a ••• Emma?
l
The infant lies still. AURORA leans over ••• then hikes
herself up by placing her foot on the mattress so she
fully leans over the bars--gracelessly to place her ear
almost atop the infant's chest. She had heard something, but doubt still lingers. Very deliberately, AORORA
pinches the infant who instantly begins wailing.
AORORA
(cont'd) There, that's better.
She moves swiftly from t.~e room and exits without a
thought of pacifying the crying baby. As she closes
the door:
COT TO:
:::XT. AORORA'S HOOSE: - EIGHT Y?ARS LATER - OAY 2
A two-door, dark car arrives. From the driver's seat
steps a man of forty in a dark blue suit and cowboy boots.
He was RODYAR.O's employer. He holds a hand out to assist
ROSIE: OONI.OP, AORORA's maid for years and, though she
doesn't know it, the last white maid in Houston. She
refuses the hand and he concentrates on the next one out,
folding back the front seat for EMMA GRE:E:~AY--misshapen for a child of eight--her legs too short, her hands too
thick--that sort of thing--hair, unusually stringy, is
even worse after t.~e sweaty and emotional funeral, a
black ribbon hangs lifeless in her tresses. She too
refuses help and indicates that t.~e man should instead
help the next occupant. That's AORORA, who emerges in
black, one hand held by the man, t.~e other by the maid.
The first thing she does on emerging from the car is to
rem:ive her shoes. She has her ar.n around her you.,g
daughter as she moves barefoot across the lawn.

EMMA shifts uncomfortably as her mo1=.her looks at her,

INT. AURORA'S HOUSE - DAY

mantle over t.,e never-used fireplace where t.,ere is a
framed picture of E:.'lMA as a ba.cy wit., her :not.,er and

OMIT SCENE 4
INT. AURORA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 5
This room is more a symbol of compromise t.,an a couple's private lair. A single heac!:coard, ~#o twin beds, barely separated with separate bedding. Aurora is vigorously brushing her teeth in the background. There is a great deal of energy a.bout her since she has an emotional
obstacle to overcome. Like someone r.:nni.~g to ~,e takeoff mark in the broadju:mp, she now mar~,es into t.,e room
frOlll the bathroom to get. into t.,e one bed which is tu=ed
down. She can't do it--it's as if she hits an invisible
wall. She makes a sudden detour and si~s on t.,e window
seat, eyes t.,e two beds, and t.,en walks quickly out of
t.,e roOlll.

AURORA

her tinal adjustment on her daughter•-not only
shoving her bra straps so they are not in evidence, but tugging each orre to hoist her daughter's breasts higher,

Nothing. What is it, Momma? I really

is soft and well-cushioned and safe.

AURORA walks the lawn barefooted under the stars. This
moment staggers her. She moves into a darker area so
that we can just see her, but we hear her sighing,
collecting herself. Suddenly she is illuminated by headlights as a long Lincoln pulls in the bordering driveway.
ANGLE ON CAR
As it stops. We see that GARRE'.:'T is in the passenger
seat sitting beside two beautiful and beautifully- dressed young women. They are almost as young as the
girls we've seen him with earlier, but there is a
great difference. They are privileged, upper strata
young women. The world owes them a living and it has shown every intention of paying up.
DORIS
Do you need some help?
GARRETT
I'll let you know after I s"tretch
my legs.
He opens the car door and falls flat on his face. He
laughs. DORIS leans out the window. She has obviously

DORIS
Because you're much older than the
boys I date, because you're drunk,
because when I went t.'iere tonight
to see a United States astronaut
give a lecture, I didn't expect him to prowl after us all night long. I expected a hero, not some

I know that you like me. I know it.
But for the last year or two you've been pretending you hate me. I love
you a lot, as much as I love anybody,
as much as I love myself. And in
a few years when I haven't been
around to be on your tail about
something or irritating you, you're going to remember my buying your
baseball glove when you thought
we were too broke, and how I read
you those stories and let you goof off instead of mowina the lawn ••.

AURORA making conversation to soothe TEDDY who keeps lapsing unexpectedly into tears or snif:ling. TOMMY
lags behind, pausing, looking back at the hospital, then catching up.
AURORA
You know, I was speaking to this
boy back in River Oaks where I live
and he was telling me how great the
Cu.b Scouts are in•Houston, just about the best there are.
TOMMY
(simply)
We never were Scouts. Our mother
was too lazy tc check it out.
AURORA'S hand hits him so hard that he is knocked down
and several :eet away by the blow. MELANIE giggles nervously. TOMMY starts to scamper away. AURORA
goes after him. He al!!IOst runs for it. She has him
by the arm. Finally, he stops struggling: he starts
crying. AURORA comforts him. Gentler than we've
seen her.
That's a boy.

INT. EMMA'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT 253
One light on. FLAP dozing in a chair. AURORA seated
across the room, looking at EMMA, who is on even more
life support systems, and now E:.'1MA looks back. Her
mother smiles at her with quiet and mystic reassurance--
their final communication. EMMA turns: AURORA looks
out the window. The door ooens, a nurse enters. She
checks EMMA. This is the same nurse who had the ~~n-in
with AUROAA. She's a bit reluctant to approach her.
She touches FLAP, who awakens.
NURSE
Mr. Horton. She's gone.

She catches herself, looks at FLU', sadness flowing again. He stands quite still, something approaching dignity.
AUROPA
(continuing) There's nothing harder, is there?
She looks at FLAP again, a step and they are in each
other's arms, AURORA kisses his brow, he kisses her
back. They look towards the bed. Then:
AUROPA
Let's go.
FLAP opens the door, he should go first.
