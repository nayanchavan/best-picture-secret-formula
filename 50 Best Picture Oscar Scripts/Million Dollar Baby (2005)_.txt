BLACK. The SOUND of a racing heart. Then:

SCRAP V.O.
Only ever met one man I wouldn't
want to fight.

INT. L.A. BOXING ARENA -- NIGHT

BIG WILLIE LITTLE sits sweating on his stool in the corner
of the ring. He's African-American, a heavyweight, and he's
cut bad under the right eye. His CUT MAN jabs coagulant
into the wound; looks up to the manager standing over him.

CUT MAN
I can't stop it.

The manager, FRANKIE DUNN, pushes him aside.

FRANKIE
Get outta the building, you useless
tit.

Frankie drops to one knee and we see his face. It's a face
that could only have been cast by generations of potato-
eaters, the kind of face that survives famines and frustrates
invaders. Look deep into his eyes and you can see this man
has been knocked to his knees, but he's always come up before
the count. Always will. Frankie picks up the kit and goes
to work on Big Willie. We're mesmerized by Frankie's hands.
It's like watching a top surgeon going for a world speed
record.

SCRAP V.O.
When I met him he was already the
best cut man in the business. Started
training and managing in the 60's,
but he never lost his gift.

Frankie cleans and flushes the wound with an adrenaline
solution, uses his thumbs to work the blood away from the
gash and packs it with a coagulant-rich salve.

BIG WILLIE
You stop it?

Frankie glances at his stop watch: 36 seconds elapsed.
FRANKIE

Cantt, Willie.

The RING DOCTOR wants to see Willy's face.

FRANKIE (CONT'D)
He's fine.

RING DOCTOR
He ain't if you don't stop that
bleeding. I'll give you one more
round.

Ring Doctor moves away as the ref whistles the five second
warning.

BIG WILLIE
What do we do? Tell me what to do.

FRANKIE
Just let him hit you.

Frankie climbs out of the ring, leaving Big Willie staring
at him, confused, as the bell rings.

SCRAP V.0.
Sometimes there's just nothing you
can do.

Willie tosses a couple of questioning looks back to Frankie
before he steps into punching range.

SCRAP V.O. (CONT'D)
Cut's too wide, too close to the
bone, maybe you got a severed vein...

Big Willie, unwilling to follow Frankie's instructions, keeps
protecting his face, his opponent trying to get to the wound.
Frankie YELLS something from the corner. Something we can't
hear over the din.

SCRAP V.O. (CONT'D)
...or you just can't get the coagulant
deep enough.

(MORE)

Willie reluctantly drops his quard. His opponent delivers a
neck-snapping blow to his cut eye. SILENCE as the camera
screams into an extreme close up of Willie's wound... and in
that second we "hear" the coagulant being absorbed deep into
the gash, “hear" the blood vessels sealing, then we fly right
back out into the fight and the ROAR of the crowd.

Willy backs off, looks to Frankie, who screams for him to
get in there and start punching.

SCRAP V.O. (CONT'D)
There are all kinds of combinations
you come up against down in the
different layers of meat. And Frankie
knew how to work every one.

Big Willie lands his first solid combination and a cheer
rises up.

SCRAP V.O. (CONT'D)
Harder thing to stop is looking.

FACES
in the crowd. Most of them ugly. Screaming for blood.

SCRAP V.O. (CONT'D)
People love violence. They'll watch
a cock slash a rooster's throat;
they slow down at car wrecks to check
for bodies. They'll stand outside a
bar, watch two friends stab each
other with knives. Same people claim
to love boxing. They got no idea
what it is.

We find...

A GIRL

fair, thin, looks early thirties; call her MAGGIE. She's
standing in the tunnel, a bruise swelling on her cheek, her
hair matted from dried sweat, a worn boxing robe pulled around

her shoulders.

SCRAP V.O. (CONT'D)
Boxing is about respect.

Her eyes stay fixed on...
FRANKIE

shouting instructions from Willie's corner. Big Willie
clutches his opponent, struggling to understand Frankie.

SCRAP V.O. (CONT'D)

The crowd roars as the referee counts out the opponent.
Maggie shifts her look to:

PRANKIE

stepping into the ring. Big Willie picks him up and hugs
him.

INT. ARENA -- CORRIDOR OUTSIDE DRESSING ROOMS -- NIGHT 2

Maggie, in jeans and an old jacket, waits outside the dressing

room. The door opens and Frankie steps out, calling back
in:

FRANKIE
I'll warm up the car.

And walks off down the corridor. Maggie catches up.

MAGGIE
Mr. Dunn?

FRANKIE
I owe you money?

MAGGIE
No, sir.

FRANKIE

I know your mother?

MAGGIE
Don't rightly know, sir.

FRANKIE

Frankie drops into the driver's seat. Willie gets in the
other side, looks to Frankie for an explanation.

FRANKIE (CONT'D)
Two-three more fights, you'll be
ready.

BIG WILLIE
Been two-three more fights a long
time now, Frankie.

FRANKIE
You get one shot at the title, Willie.
Lose, it may never come back around.
Two-three more fights, you'll be
ready.

BIG WILLIE

Whatever you say, Frankie.

And they drive off.
SCRAP V.O.
Frankie liked to say that boxing is
an unnatural act...
INT. CITY BUS -- NIGHT
Maggie rides along Olympic, the only one on the bus.
SCRAP V.O.
That everything in boxing is

backwards.

For a brief second she allows the fear in; fear that she'll
break before she gets what she's after.

INT. FRANKIE'S BUNGALOW - CULVER CITY -- NIGHT

With some effort and more than a little pain he drops to one
knee beside his single bed, crosses himself.

SCRAP V.O.
Sometimes best way to deliver a punch
is to step back.

FRANKIE
Dear Lord, do your best to protect
Katy. Annie, too. Other than that,
you know what I want, Lord, not gonna
repeat myself.

SCRAP V.O.
But step back too far, you ain't
fighting at all.

He crosses himself.
EXT. ST. RAYMOND'S CATHOLIC CHURCH -- MORNING

Post mass, the last few parishioners exit. Frankie is the
last out the door.

FRANKIE
Beautiful sermon, Father, made me
weep.

FATHER HORVATH
What's confusing you this week?

FRANKIE
It's the one God, three God thing
again.

FATHER HORVATH
Frankie, most people figure out by
Kindergarten that it's about faith.

FRANKIE
Is it sorta like Snap, Crackle, Pop,
all in one big box?

FATHER HORVATH
You're standing on the steps of my
church comparing God to Rice Crispies?
The only reason you come to mass
every day is to try and wind me up;
it's not gonna happen this morning.

PATHER HORVATH
Then here's your answer: there's one
God! Anything else, cause I'm busy?

FRANKIE
What about the Holy Ghost?

FATHER HORVATH
He's an expression of God's love.

FRANKIE
--And Jesus? -

FATHER HORVATH
Son of God, don't play stupid!

FRANKIE
So, that makes him what, a demigod?

FATHER HORVATH
There are no demigods, you fuckin!
pagan! Did you write your daughter?!

FRANKIE
Absolutely.

FATHER HORVATH
Now you're lying to a priest. You
know what? Take a day off, don't
come to mass tomorrow.

The priest disappears into the church. Frankie smiles and

walks off.

INT. HOLLYWOOD DINER -- MORNING

Four hip looking customers leave their table a complete mess.
Maggie, wearing an ill-fitting uniform, steps in to bus it.

SCRAP V.0O.
Some people'd say the most important
thing a fighter can have is heart.

INT. THE HIT PIT -- DAY

A basement gym on 5th Street, right in the heart of Skid
Row, downtown LA. Everyone sweats, even those who are just
hanging out on the short bleachers that circle the two rings.

SCRAP V.O.
Frankie'd say show me a fighter who's
nothing but heart and I'll show you
a man waiting for a beating.

Trainers, swaying like cobras, work their fighters, isolated
in the noise and the steam, some whisper, others yell. Boom
boxes blare different music from four corners, making it
sound like a cell biock.

SCRAP V.0. (CONT'D)
Think I only ever met one Fighter
whe was all heart.

DANGER BARCH, a scrawny young farmer white boy, throws a
flurry of pitty-pat punches into the air, then announces:

DANGER
My name's Dangerous Dillard Fightin!’
Flippo Bam-Bam Barch outta Broward
County, Texas--

FREEZE him in mid sentence.
SCRAP V.O.
Danger showed up a coupl'a years
back.
EXT. SKID ROW - FLASHBACK -- DAY

Danger steps outta the passenger seat of a beat up old Dodge
pickup, looks around.

SCRAP V.0.
He'd come visitin' L.A. with Ervel,
his momma's new boyfriend.
The Dodge disappears in a cloud of exhaust.

SCRAP V.0O. (CONT'D)

INT. THE HIT PIT -- DAY 10

Danger stands across the counter from EDDIE SCRAP IRON DUPRIS,
a long-retired fighter who cleans up around the gym in
exchange for living in the back room. In his day, Scrap was
a hell of a fighter, and he still keeps himsel= fit. He

lost the sight in one eye years ago.

DANGER
I gots nothin' against niggers.

SCRAP
Glad to hear it.

Scrap gives him a paper cup full of water.

DANGER
Lotsa people where I comes from does,
but my mamma taught me not to cause
hurt to no man, niggers or not.

SCRAP
You got a good mamma. Anything else
I can do for you?

Danger thinks hard.

SCRAP V.O.
It was just one of those questions
you ask, but Danger wanted to give
it his best answer.

DANGER
I'd likes to become the Welterweight
Champion of the world.

INT. HIT PIT - BACK TO THE PRESENT - DAY Li

SHAWRELLE BERRY, a tough young lightweight, wraps his hands
as he sits on a nearby bench with some gym rat buddies --
one of them his sparring partner, OMAR.

SHAWRELLE
Flippy, you ain't even ranked. To
get ranked, you gotta have at least
one fight.

DANGER
I'll fight any man, anytime!

The gym rats laugh.

SHAWRELLE
You're a brave man. Wanna get in
the ring, go a few rounds with me?

Scrap passes with a bucket, mop and bottle of Clorox.

SCRAP
Leave him be, Shawrelle. Danger,
get back to your training.

DANGER
Will do, Mist Scrap!

Danger goes back to throwing his best pitty-pat punches into
the air. Shawrelle and his buddies laugh and mimic him.

SCRAP V.O.
Shawrelle Berry had a left hook that
could move'a tank. But he had a
heart the size of a split pea.

Frankie steps out of his back office, throwing a look toward
Danger as he heads to the front desk.

SCRAP V.O. (CONT'D)
Frankie bought The Hit Pit from Bobby
Malone seventeen years ago. Bobby
wanted to move to Florida and Frankie
wanted some security. Bobby died
while he was packing and Frankie
found out most gyms lose money.

Frankie steps behind the counter to check the log.

work out here anymore.

Frankie notices the Clorox bottle.

FRANKIE (CONT'D)
How many times I tell you that bleach
is bleach? Why do you have to buy
the stuff that costs more?

SCRAP
Cause it smells better.

FRANKIE
It's bleach. It smells like bleach!

Frankie heads back to his office. Big Willie enters, nods
to Scrap, who's now behind the counter.

BIG WILLIE
Hey, Scrap.

SCRAP
Hey, Mr. Willie.

Scrap watches Big Willie passing a couple fighters, saying
hello, slapping hands. Willie passes a couple slickly dressed
managers, cracking jokes to each other. One is SALLY MENDOZA,
the other is MICKEY MACK.

BIG WILLIE
Hey, Sally.

SALLY
Hey, Willie. Nice fight, people are
talking.

Mickey doesn't look at Willie, Willie doesn't look at Mickey.
Scrap files this away.

SCRAP
Not a word, neither one of them.

Scrap walks behind Frankie's chair, to the window that looks
out on the gym.

MAGGIE
Thirty two. Till my birthday.

FRANKIE
You wouldn't start training to be a
ballerina at thirty-two, would you?

MAGGIE
Already been working it three years.

FRANKIE
And you can't even hit a speed bag;
you had some real good training.

MAGGIE
Never had any, boss.

FRANKIE
I hate to say it, but it shows.
Figure somebody should tell you the
truth.

Maggie tries to hide how deeply this hurts her. She fails.

MAGGIE
Yeah. Sorry for using your bag, Mr.

Willie, the title is two fights away.

BIG WILLIE

It's not that. It's just like you
said, I got one shot. If I win, I
gotta make as much as I can while I

he stuck around this long.

FRANKIE
Gettin' there and taking the belt

SCRAP
So, you were protecting him from
being champ. Now it's making sense.

FRANKIE
How'd your manager do for you, Scrap?
You were a hell of a fighter, better
than Willie, he get you a title fight?
Or did he bust you out banging your
head into other people's fists until
you lost your eye?

SCRAP
I had my shot. Went out swinging,

INT. HIT PIT -- CONTINUOUS 29
Maggie works at the speed bag, watches Scrap come out of the
office and sit, stewing. She knows something just happened.
MONTAGE BEGINS:
INT. VENICE RESTAURANT ~-- MORNING 30
Maggie buses a table. Slips the dirty dishes into the rubber
tray, except for a half-eaten steak sandwich, which she
carefully removes. She looks around, then wraps it in some
scrap tin foil. She looks up to see the cook watching her.

MAGGIE
For my dog.

INT. HIT PIT -- DAY 31
Maggie takes out her frustrations on the speed bag. The

fighter next to her makes it circle in a perfect eight.

Seeing that makes her hit it harder.

INT. HOLLYWOOD DINER -- NIGHT 32

Maggie realizes some teenagers left without paying. Chases
them out to...

Maggie slams away at the heavy bag -- still flat footed, but
really moving. Frankie glances at her from behind the

counter, goes back to his work.

INT. VENICE RESTAURANT 38

Maggie finds a two dollar tip on the table soaking in a pool
of spilled gravy. She wipes the bills clean, pockets them.

INT. MAGGIE'S APARTMENT -- DAY 393
Maggie rolls her tips into wrappers as she eats some scraps.
INT. SPORTING GOODS STORE -- DAY 40
Maggie puts a new speed bag on the counter and digs out dozens
of rolls of quarters, dimes, nickels and some crumpled

singles. The cashier gives her a look that could kill.

INT. FRANKIE'S HOUSE - MONTAGE CONTINUES -- NIGHT 41
Frankie sits on the edge of his sofa, eyes fixed on a tiny

TV set. There's a fight on the screen: Willie and the champ;
each fighter taking a lot of punishment.

Frankie's face betrays every nuance of the match.

SCRAP V.0O.
Boxing is an unnatural act.

The Champ throws a barrage of punches, going for a knockout.

SCRAP V.O. (CONT'D)
Cause everything in it is backwards.

Frankie's feet shift slightly. We cut to the screen and see
that Willie just did the same.

SCRAP V.O. (CONT'D)

Frankie pushes right. So does Willy, just before he delivers
two devastating lefts to the body and a stunning overhand
right - the same move that Frankie called in his last fight.

SCRAP V.O. (CONT'D)
Instead of running from the pain,
like a sane person would do, you
step into it.

The champ staggers. Frankie's feet shift forward as Willie
steps right in and puts the champ down for the count. The
crowd roars. Frankie turns off the set, sits back, allows
himself a smile. It fades after a second.

SCRAP V.O. (CONT'D)
Everything in boxing is backwards.

INT. BROADWAY DINER -- NIGHT 42

Frankie drops into a seat at the counter, scans the menu.
The counterman places half a cup of coffee before him.

FRANKIE
You still make your lemon pie with

Frankie walks toward the dimly lit gym. Sees Maggie, sweat
soaked, working the speed bag, making all the same mistakes
and punishing herself for it. Frankie watches, unseen. She
stops, breathing heavy. Frankie steps out into the light.

She hides a flash of pain, something very deep.

Maggie gets inside on sheer guts, goes to town on the girl's
torso. The girl pushes her back and comes over Maggie's
lazy left, catching her hard.

FRANKIE (CONT'D)
Jesus!

SCRAP
Course, Maggie loses, it don't mean
much to Sally. Might even help him.
Lonnie's girl gets another win, maybe
Lonnie let Sally's lightweight fight
Joey Adagio for the title.

FRANKIE
Sally's trying to set a fight with
Adagio?

SCRAP

What do I know? I just comes cause
I enjoy the fights.

Maggie drops her left again and pays the price.

FRANKIE

The bell rings and Frankie springs off the back wall. He's
cingside before the fighters even get to their corners,
calling up through the ropes.

FRANKIE (CONT'D)
C'mere-cimere!

Maggie goes to him, squatting. Sally is in the ring with
the stool in his hand...

Fine! You take her! Can't fight

Sally climbs out of the ring.

The bell sounds. Maggie stands, Frankie grabs her wrist
pulls her back to the ropes.

She cocks the right, take a short
step back and fire a good night hook.
You got one in you?

MAGGIE
Got it right here.

REF
Fight or I'm calling it!

FRANKIE
Then go give it to her.

The fighters circle, trading jabs. Scrap steps up to Frankie

Maggie throws a couple jabs. Her opponent watches, waiting
for the left to drop. Maggie jabs again.

SCRAP V.O.
The body knows what fighters don't:
how to protect itself. A neck can
only twist so far. Twist it just a
hair more and the body says ‘I'll
take it from here, cause you obviously
don't know what you're doing'

Maggie pulls a jab back, lets her left drop. Watches. Sees
that right shoulder cock. As the punch comes Maggie drops
back unharmed and unpacks a powerful hook. It snaps her
opponent's head hard to the right, making her body go limp...

SCRAP V.O. (CONT'D)
‘Lie down now, rest and we'll talk
about this when you regain your
senses.'

...and she finds comfort on the canvass.

Maggie jabs, snaps her left back. Jab, jab, snaps her left
back; not high enough.

That coulda been a mistake.

Dredlocks comes over Maggie's left and hits her with a lead
weight right. And everything goes QUIET as Maggie's nose
BREAKS. Maggie dances back, shakes it off as best she can,
but the blood is pouring. And the bell rings.

Maggie drops onto her stool. Frankie is in the ring in a
flash, fending off the RING DOCTOR who wants a look.

doctor's gonna call it.

She stops shouting and digs down deep into some pain we can
only glimpse.

MAGGIE
Please, Frankie. If you can stop
the blood I can beat her.

Everything in Frankie says don't do this. But he shoves a
rag into her mouth, takes her nose between his thumb and
forefinger and cracks it back into place. Maggie almost
bites through that rag before he yanks it back out. Frankie
tries not to look into her eyes as he cleans out the blood
and packs adrenaline rich salve up her nose.

turns into a geyser and you'll be
spraying blood all over the front
row. Twenty seconds, that's all you
got.

The ring doctor is there, does a quick check.

RING DOCTOR
Okay!

Frankie gives Maggie one last deep look and climbs out. The
bell RINGS and everything goes SILENT again -- except for

the THROBBING in Maggie's ears. She strides out of her
corner, fire in her eyes. Her opponent throws everything
she's got. Maggie ducks and cripples the girl with two blows
to the solar plexus.

The girl pulls her arms down to protect her gut and Maggie
hammers her in the temple. She clutches.

Maggie shoves her away and delivers a lightning combination
that puts her out. The girl falls in SLOW MOTION, Maggie
turns to look for Frankie. She doesn't hear him whisper:

Billie was a former prostitute,

Billie comes out of the corner breathing fire.

SCRAP V.O. (CONT'D)

from all angles, easily beating girls
from Berlin to Australia. Hada
reputation for being the dirtiest
fighter in the ranks.

Billie jams the palm of her glove into her opponent's nose.

the roll over her shoulder and sticks the tape to the skin
on the back of her neck. She pulls it down over the other
side and winds it around her left wrist again, so that her
glove is held up in front of her face. She pulls her right
glove on with her teeth and steps out of shot. THUD. THUD.

patch me up, and he keeps saying
he's gonna throw in the towel; but
he ain't my manager, he can't throw
in nothin'. Round after round, he's
arguing with me and I'm damn near

Lose my eye the next morning.

INT. A CAVERNOUS DRESSING ROOM - LONDON -- NIGHT 92

The place is so large that it dwarfs Frankie and Maggie. He
tapes her second hand, Maggie tests it. A PAKISTANT man
with Cockney accent peeks in through the door:

PAKISTANT
Ten minutes, luv.

MAGGIE
Thank you.

Man says he loves me.

PRANKIE
I'm sure he's not the first.

MAGGIE
First since my daddy. I win, you
think he'll propose?

FRANKIE
You win, I'il propose.

It was a joke, something said off the cuff, but suddenly
Frankie feels embarrassed. Maggie senses it, is charmed.
Frankie snatches a box out of the bag on the floor.

FRANKIE (CONT'D)
Hurry up and put this on.

She looks at him, curious, then tears it open to find a Kelly
green silk robe. She turns it over, sees a golden Gaelic
harp and the words Mo Cuishle emblazoned in Celtic lettering.

INT. LONDON ARENA -- NIGHT 93

Frankie walks Maggie toward the ring. A couple of young
Irish men on the aisle take notice of her robe. One whispers
to the other.

SCRAP V.O.
She wasn't the main attraction.

R red-headed woman notices the robe and says something to
the man beside her.

SCRAP V.O. (CONT'D)
She was on the undercard of a
middleweight title fight.

The tough JAMAICAN punches Maggie like a speeding train.
Her fists fly so fast Maggie can barely block the punches.

SCRAP V.O.
But ask someone who was there, they
couldn't tell you who else fought
that night.

Maggie dances away, overwhelmed, trying to figure out how to
fight this girl. Frankie yells from the corner. The Jamaican
charges and smothers Maggie in punches. Maggie blocks and
dances away; she can't get a punch off. The beil.

and counterpunches, landing a stunning combination to the

torso. A lone cheer comes up from the crowd:

The Jamaican comes back with amazing speed. Maggie blocks
and counters, rocking her back with an uppercut to the jaw.

SECOND IRISH MAN
Mo Cuishle!!

NOW THREE TOGETHER
Mo Cuishle!!! Mo Cuishle!!

Maggie looks around, confused by the shouting. With her
guard down, the Jamaican connects. Maggie beats back the
attack. Several more people take up the chant.

You're not gonna tell me what it

FRANKIE

Frankie grabs the stool and climbs out. The bell sounds and
the Jamaican rushes, throwing punches so fast she looks like
she has four arms. Maggie blocks, then counters with a flurry
of her own. The Irish crowd goes wild and now almost all of
them are chanting:

IRISH FANS
Mo Cuishle!! Mo Cuishle!: Mo
Cuishle!! Mo Cuishlei!

The Jamaican staggers, Maggie presses, unleashing a gorgeous
combination, ending in a hook that spins the Jamaican on her
heels and drops her to the mat. The Irish fans go wild!
Maggie dances back to the corner as the ref counts the
Jamaican out.

Frankie grins, shakes his head. He calls up to her, but she
can't hear him over the yelling and the chanting.

Frankie and Maggie drive in silence, passing one tiny
depressed town after another until they pull into:

They pass a line of rusted trailers; kids and dogs everywhere,
families sprawled in lawn chairs and watching televisions.
They pull to a stop in front of a rusting mobile home.

The passenger door opens and a gargantuan leg swings out and
hits the ground, followed by a second. The back door opens
and an equally large leg finds the earth. We move up to see
EARLINE and her daughter MARDELL emerge from Frankie's car.
Mardell carries a screaming child. Her four-year old boy
scrambles out of the back seat as Maggie rises from the other
side of the car, her excitement obvious.

EBEARLINE
This is the Johnson's old house.

EXT. THEODOSIA - SERVICE STATION -- EVENING 105

Frankie fills the tank. He looks up from the pump, sees
Maggie sitting in the passenger seat, staring out the window,
trying not to feel or think and failing at both. Something
makes her look at the old pickup at the other pump.

A scrawny girl, maybe ten, sits in the pick up stroking the
old hound dog beside her. Her father returns, handing her a
string of red licorice, before leaning across to pull her

door shut. The girl smiles at Maggie before they drive off.

Frankie gets back into the rental, sees Maggie smiling.

MAGGIE
You ever own a dog?

FRANKIE
Nope. Close as I ever came was a
middleweight from Barstow.

He starts the car and they pull out.

MAGGIE
My daddy had a German Shepard, Axel.
Axel’s hindquarters were so bad he
had to drag himself room to room by
his front legs. Me and Mardell'd
bust up watchin' him scoot cross the
kitchen floor. Daddy was so sick by
then, he couldn’t hardly stand
himself, but one morning he got up,
carried Axel to his rig and the two
of them went off into the woods,

knock him down.

Scrap careens off the fighters standing, stunned, around the
ving. He lunges through the ropes and slams Shawrelle in
the chest, shoving him to the far corner.

Scrap cradles Danger's swollen head in his hands -- his eyes

bloody slobber spilling from his mouth.

his head, same side as his bad eye. Scrap staggers but he
doesn't go down. Shawrelle tries the same shot but Scrap

chest like she's ramming her with the end of a two by four.

The bell sounds. Frankie swings the stool through the ropes.

Scrap leans back a bit, realizes he's sweating.

Billie on the canvas.

The Bear bounces up and grabs Maggie, tries to throw her to

Do that again, it'll cost you a point!

Billie ignores him, shoves Maggie again. The ref turns to
the scorers table and signals them to...

REF (CONT'D)
Take away a point.

And with his back turned he doesn't see the Bear catch Maggie
with an elbow.

FRANKIE

THE FIGHT 122
Maggie's eye is almost swollen closed. It doesn't stop her

from nailing Billie repeatedly, knocking the Bear back into

the ropes. But Billie stays up. Head-butts Maggie.

REP
Two points! You're warned!

Maggie takes the fight to Billie again. Billie head-butts
her. The ref pushes her back, holds up five fingers and

Frankie watches from the hall as another nurse and resident
roll Maggie on her side.

SCRAP V.O.
There were blood clots in her legs
and problems with hemoglobin. To
induce a daily bowel movement, she
was placed on her side and pressure
was applied to her lower abdomen.

We can't see what the resident is doing, but we can assume
he's inserting tube in her rectum. Maggie catches Frankie's
eye. He gives her a little smile.

we're all makin' a terrible fuss.
So she packs us up and we drive forty-
two miles to the Stop and Go in
Domain, where Mamma buys us super-~-
size Cherry Slurpees. Tells us
that'll fix us up. It doesn't, of

FRANKIE (CONT'D)
Thought I'd buy you one of those
wheelchairs you can use by blowin’
into a straw. Thought you might
want to go to school.

MAGGIE
I got a favor to ask you, boss.

FRANKIE
Whatever you want.

MAGGIE
Remember what my daddy did for Axel?

FRANKTE
...-Don't even say that.

MAGGIE

I can't be like this, Frankie. Not
after what I done. I seen the world.
People chanted my name. Well, not
my name, some damn name you gave me,
but they were chanting for me. I
was in magazines. You think I ever
dreamed that'd happen?

(beat)
I was born at two pound one and a
half ounces. Daddy used to tell me
I fought to get into this world and
It'd fight my way out. That's all I

wanna do, boss. I just don't want
to fight you to do it.
(beat)

Only two people in this world I ever
wanted to be proud of me. You are
one. You proud of me, boss?

FRANKIE
You have to ask?

MAGGIE
I got what I needed, boss. Got it
all. Don't let em keep takin' it
away from me. Don't let me lie here
till I can't hear those people
chanting no more.

FRANKIE

...i can't do it. Please, don't ask
me.

MAGGIE
I am asking.

FRANKIE
Io can't.

She nods and turns her head away.

INT. FRANKIE'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 163
The phone rings, waking Frankie from a dead sleep.

INT. FRANKIE'S KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS 164
He snatches it up.

FRANKIE
Hellio?...

INT. EVERGREEN REHAB CENTER -- NIGHT 165

Frankie hustles down the corridor, met by an intern, who
talks as he tries to keep up.

SCRAP V.0.
In the middle of the night, Maggie'd
found her own solution. She bit off
her tongue.

Frankie fires into the room, shoving aside a male nurse to
see Maggie, trying to fight away the doctor by banging her
head back and forth. Frankie grabs her head, holds it, looks
into her wild eyes as the doctor administers another shot.

SCRAP V.O. (CONT'D)
Nearly bled to death before they
stitched her up. She came round and
ripped them out before Frankie even
got there.

He soothes her and let's the shot take hold. Her eyes half
closed and Frankie steps away to let the doctor in to stitch.

CORRIDOR
As Frankie paces, running his hand through his hair.
SCRAP V.O. (CONT'D)
They stitched her up again, padded
the tongue so she couldn't bite, and

gave her a tracheotomy, so she could
breathe.

He looks back into the room.

INT, EVERGREEN REHAB CENTER - MAGGIE'S WARD -- MORNING
Maggie slowly comes out of it. Her eyes find Frankie

FRANKIE
What'd you do, darlin'?

He wipes away the tears that flow down her cheeks.

FRANKIE (CONT'D)
You just gonna keep fighting me,
aren't you?

She blinks once for yes.

EXT. STREETS -- NIGHT

Frankie walks, stops. Realizes that he is lost.

EXT. ST. RAYMOND'S CATHOLIC CHURCH -~ MORNING
Frankie sits on the steps, Father Horvath beside him.

FATHER HORVATH
You can't do it. You know that.

FRANKIE

I do. But she's thick, Father. You
have no idea how hard it was to train
her. I had to explain every little
thing, things any other fighter would
just do without asking, she'd want
to know why and how and then she'd
do it her way anyway. I got no idea
how she ended up fighting for the
title--didn't get there by listening
to me.

(beat)
Now, all she wants is to die, and
all I want to do is keep her with
me. And God forgive me, but it feels
like I'm committing a sin by doing
it. By keeping her alive, I'm killing
her. How do you find your way out
of that?

FATHER HORVATE

You don't. You step aside, Frankie,
you leave it with God.

FRANKIE
She's not asking for God's help.
She's asking for mine.

FATHER HORVATH
Frankie, I've seen you at mass almost
every day for twenty-three years.
Only person who goes to church that
much is the kind who can't forgive
himself for something. Whatever
sins you're carrying, they're nothing
compared to this. Forget about God
or Heaven and Hell. If you do this
thing, you'll be lost; somewhere so
deep, you'll never find yourself
again.

Frankie knows it's true.
INT. EVERGREEN REHAB CENTER ~- AFTERNOON 169
Frankie sits with Maggie as she sleeps.
NURSE
We're keeping her sedated so she

won't try that again.

Frankie nods, watches the nurse leave. Looks at Maggie's

eyes fluttering, trying to find him. Lost. He stands, kisses
her head.
INT. HIT PIT -- NIGHT 170

Frankie takes his cut bag out of the locked drawer, places
it on his desk. Takes several bottles of adrenaline from
the drawer, places them in the bag along with a syringe. He
looks up and notices Scrap watching from the doorway.

SCRAP
I went in to see Maggie this morning.
You musta been somewhere else.

PRANKIE
Yeah.

Frankie locks his drawer.

SCRAP
You got a fight I don't know about?

FRANKIE
.it wasn't your fault. I was wrong
to say that.

SCRAP
Damn right it wasn't. I found you a
fighter, and you made her the best
fighter she coulda been.

FRANKIE
I killed her.

SCRAP

(scoffs)
Killed her. That girl waiked in
here with nothin' but guts, she had
no hope of becoming what she needed
to be. A year and a half later, she
fought for the championship of the
world. People die every day, washing
dishes and sweeping floors, and their
last thought is that they never got
their shot. Cause of you, Maggie
got hers. You know how many people
in this world get that?

(beat)
If Maggie died today, I bet her last
thought would be, I did pretty good.

(beat)
I could rest knowing that.

Frankie snaps shut his bag but doesn't lift it. A moment.

PRANKIE
Yeah.

He nods and then leaves.

EXT. EVERGREEN REHAB CENTER -- NIGHT 171
Frankie sits in his car for an eternity.

INT. EVERGREEN REHAB CENTER -- NIGHT 172

He walks down the corridor. The night nurse is on rounds,
the desk lies empty. He steps into...

MAGGTE'S ROOM 173
She opens her eyes when she hears him. He smiles, gives her

a kiss on the head. He looks her in the eyes, the question
hanging there. She blinks once, he nods.

He reaches into his bag.

FRANKIE
I'm going to put pressure on your
neck, it'll cut off your air and put
you to sleep, okay?

She blinks.

FRANKIE (CONT'D)
Then I'm gonna give you a shot...and
you'll just stay sleeping.

She blinks, offers a small smile. He flicks off the alarm
on her monitor, then puts his hand on her throat and looks
her in the eye. Asks himself again if he can do this. She
gives him a smile and blinks once. He leans in close to her
ear and whispers.

FRANKIE (CONT'D)
Mo Cuishle. It means "my darling,
my blood."

And she beams. Then blinks and closes her eyes for him. He
applies pressure to her neck.

ANGLE ON HIS BAG

he removes a syringe, loads it up with adrenaline. His hand
leaves the shot.

SCRAP V.O.
He gave her a single shot where
they wouldn't see much of a needle
mark. It was enough adrenaline to
do the job a few times over. He
didn't want her going through this
again.

His hand drops the syringe back in his bag.
FRANKIE

feels for her pulse. Gone. Strokes her hair. Kisses her
forehead. Takes his bag and walks out.

SCRAP V.O. (CONT'D)
Then he walked out.

Scrap sits on the bench.
SCRAP V.0O.
I went back to the gym. Waited,
figuring he'd turn up sooner or later.
DISSOLVE TO:
175 INT. HIT PIT -- DAY 175
Scrap sits on the same bench. He looks up, smiles...
SCRAP V.0O.
And that's when a ghost came through
the door.
The person sits. It's Danger.
DANGER
Got to thinking what you said, Mist
Scrap.
SCRAP
What was that, Danger?
DANGER
Anybody can lose one fight.
SCRAP
And that's the truth. Go put on
your gloves, you missed a lot of
training.
DANGER
Sure will, Mist. Scrap.
176 INT. FPRANKIE'S OFFICE --~ CONTINUOUS 176

Serap opens the door, looks in. Frankie's desk lies bare,
save a single key lying on the rough leather.

SCRAP V.O.
Frankie never came back at all.

BACK IN THE GYM

Danger throws his pitty-pat punches in the direction of the
heavy bag. Scrap passes on his way out.

SCRAP

Danger, you hit something or I'm
gonna toss your ass outta here.

Danger is so shocked he actually smacks the bag good and

hard. He looks around, stunned and amazed and as pleased as
hell. And as he throws his arms up in the air and opens his
mouth...

INT. FRANKIE'S BUNGALOW -- DAY 177

Scrap opens Frankie's front door, pockets the single key.

SCRAP V.O.
Frankie didn't leave a note.

IN THE KITCHEN 178
He checks the fridge. Empty.

SCRAP V.O.
No one knew where he went.

IN THE BEDROOM

He opens the closet. The clothes are gone. Ali that's left
are a few shoe-boxes. Curious, Scrap reaches up for one.

SCRAP V.0O. (CONT'D)
I hoped he'd gone to find you.

IN THE KITCHEN

sits at the single chair and opens the box, removing the
letters one at a time. All are unopened. All addressed to
Katy Dunn, an address in Indiana. All are marked "return to
sender".

SCRAP V.O. (CONT'D)
Ask you one more time to forgive
him.
INT. HIT PIT - FRANKIE'S OFFICE -- NIGHT 179
Scanning across the pages of a long, hand written letter.

We pick out phrases we heard Scrap say... ."“Set-in the cedars
and oak trees, somewhere between nowhere and good-bye"...

"Boxing is an unnatural act..." We finally find Scrap's
hand, writing the current page.

SCRAP V.O.
But I don't think he had anything
left in his heart.

EXT. ROADSIDE DINER -~ MISSOURI -- NIGHT 180

The place looks familiar. It could be that place where
Frankie and Maggie stopped. The place with the best lemon
pie in the world,

SCRAP V.O.
I just hope he found someplace where
he could find a little peace.

With its rough hewn exterior, it looks an awful lot like a
cabin. Through the windows we think we catch a glimpse of
Frankie behind the counter. But we can't be sure, maybe the
owner just looked a little like him.

SCRAP V.O. (CONT'D)
But that's probably wishful thinking.
No matter where he is... I thought
you should know what kind of man
your father really was.
