"PATTON"

(NOTE: All scenes in which
Germans speak will be shot in
German, with English subtitles.)

FADE IN
EXT, PLATFORM - MED. VIEW - DAY

Our entire frame is filled with the image of an American
flag, stretched tight. We hear a jumble of conversation
in the b.g.3; then:

_ VOICE

(o.8.)
At-ten-shun!

Now we hear the click of hundreds of boots. GENERAL
GEORGE S. PATTON, JR. steps into cur view; more than
six feet tall, he looms high against the b.g. of the
flag. He glares down at us, the audience.

A MILITARY BAND plays THE STAR SPANGLED BANNER, Patton
comes to a smart salute, and we watch him for the dura-
tion of the entire anthem. He is straight and husky and
as gaudy as a peacock. His heimet is lacquered and
shines with four silver stars. He wears a tailored tunic,
with four stars on each shoulder, thirty brightly hued
decorations on the left breast, five horizontal and three
diagonal gold stripes on the sleeve. Beneath the tunic,
he wears a shirt with four stars on each lapel, making a

‘total of twenty stars. A vivid blue sash is draped

across his breast, parallel to one of yellow. A red
eollar sash weighted by another medal hangs from his neck.
The rest of his costume consists of a gold-buckled belt,
with his ivory-handled pistols on either side, riding
breeches, boots, and a riding crop. Four stars on the
handle of his pistols brings the grand total to twenty-
elght stars. On his fingers he wears four conspicuous
rings.

SERIES OF CUTS

As the anthem continues, we cut to a series of tight
shots featuring various aspects of Patton's uniform and
decorations -- emphasizing the clusters of stars on his
shoulders, his shirt, his pistols,

CLOSE SHOT - PATTON

The anthem concludes and he completes his salute. Now
this twenty-eight-star general scans us carefully. In
a vibrant voice, and with a cold, mean look, he speaks
directly at us;

PATTON
At ease, men, I want you to remember
that no bastard ever won a war by
dying for his country. He won it by
making the other poor dumb bastard
die for his country... Men, the stuff
we heard about America not wanting
to fight, wanting to Stay out of the
war, was a lot of horsedung. Americans
traditionally love to Tight. All real
Americans love the sting of battle.
When you were kids you all admired the
Champion marble player, the fastest
runner, the big league ballplayers, the
toughest boxers. Americans love a
winner and do not tolerate a loser.
Americans play to win all the time.
I wouldn't give a hoot in heli for a
man who lost and laughed. That's why
Americans have never lost, and will
never lose a war, for the very thought
of losing is hateful to Americans,
An army is a team. It lives, sleeps,
eats, fights as a team. This individu-
ality stuff is a lot of crap. The
bilious bastards who wrote that stuff
about individuality for the Saturday
Evening Post don't know any more about
real battle than they do about a sock
full of silt. We have the finest
food, equipment, the best spirit and
men in the world. Why, by God, I
actually pity those poor bastards
we're going against -- by God, I do.
We won't just shoot the bastards.
We're going to cut out their living
guts and use them to grease the
treads of our tanks. We're going to
murder those lousy Hun bastards by
the bushel. Many of you boys are
wondering whether you'll chicken out
under fire. Don't worry about its;
I can assure you you will all do your
duty. The Nazis are the enemy. Wade
into them and spill their blood,
Shoot them in the belly. When you
stick your hand into a bunch of goo
that a moment before was your best
friend's face...you'li know what to

PATTON (Cont. )

do. There's another thing I want you
to remember. I don't want to get any
messages saying: ‘We are holding our
position.' We're not holding anything.
Let the Hun do that. We are advancing
constantly and are not interested in
holding anything, except onto the
enemy. We're going to hold onto him
by the nose and kick him in the ass.
We'll kick the hell out of him all
the time. We'll go through them like
crap through a goose.

(pause)
There's one thing you men will be able
to say when you get home. You may all
thank God for it. Thirty years from
now, when you are sitting around the
fireside with your grandson on your
knee and he asks what you did in the
Great World War II, you won't have to
say, 'I shoveled shit in Louisiana. '!

(pause)
All right --~ now you sonsuvbitches
know how I feel. I will be proud to °
lead you wonderful guys into battle
anytime, anywhere.

He stares sincerely, almost wet-eyed at us for a moment,

PATTON
That is ail,

 

NOTE: TITLES TO RUN OVER SCENES 10 - 12
EXT. DESERT NEAR KASSERINE - EXTREME LONG SHOT - DAY

SUBTITLE: NORTH AFRICA - THE KASSERINE PASS -
FEBRUARY, 1943

We view the enormous Sloping desert, baking hot in the
midday sun. Tanks, half-tracks and self-propelled
artillery are spread about in the distance. Scattered
over the hot sands are the bodies of dead Americans.
Arab women and children, dressed in brightly colored
costumes, scavenge the uniforms, boots and equipment
and pack them on heavily laden camels,

MED, SHOT - ARAB WOMEN

One woman, an infant strapped to her back and a small
child helping her, strips a soldier totally naked and
hurries the precious belongings to the camel pack. The
women work quickly and silently; there are no games, no
joking, no playing with the treasure.

We hear the sound of motor vehicles approaching.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Shimmering in the rising heat waves, two jeeps come into
scene and pull up to a halt. In the rear are two American
generals and, beside the Driver, a Captain who carries

a submachine gun.. The Major General carries a Springfield
'O3 rifle across his lap. In the other jeep is Bradley's
Second Aide, who carries a bazooka, The Captain fires a
burst of his submachine gun into the air to frighten off
the Arab women, and they scurry toward their camels,

CLOSE SHOT - MAJOR GENERAL

He shields his eyes from the sun as he rises to study the
battlefield grimly. He is a tall, lanky, gentle-looking
man. His face has great strength, but his eyes reflect
wisdom and understanding.

SUBTITLE: MAJOR GENERAL OMAR N. BRADLEY,
REPRESENTATIVE OF GENERAL EISENHOWER

(NOTE: Bradley will carry a Springfield in Africa, a
carbine in Sicily and a .45 in Europe.)

CLOSE SHOT - CAPTAIN

He is a man in his mid-twenties. He, too, is affected by
the scene of carnage.

SUBTITLE: CAPTAIN CHESTER B. HANSEN,
AIDE TO GENERAL BRADLEY

MED. LONG SHOT - THEIR P.O.V.

As the camera pans across the bitter scene, the Arab
women melt into the arid folds of the desert.

TWO SHOT - REAR OF COMMAND CAR

Beside Bradley is BRIGADIER GENERAL CARVER. (Fictitious
character -- no subtitle.) Sinee he participated in the
debacle, he is diffident about commenting on it --
especially to a representative of General Eisenhower,

CARVER
The Arabs need food and clothing.
They strip our dead before we can
even bury them.

BRADLEY
(studying the scene)
Looks like the reports were accurate.

CARVER
(consulting a pad)
Sixty-one armored vehicles -- forty-
five tons of ammunition -- twenty-

five 40mm guns -- three self-propelled
105s. Not counting mortars, machine
guns, rifles, pistols, telescopes,
belt buckles, GI socks.

killing ground. ,

EXT. PARADE GROUND AT MARRAKECH - MED. CLOSE SHOT -
MOUNTED KETTLEDRUMMER - DAY

SUBTITLE: MARRAKECH -- MOROCCO - 1943

The exotically caparisoned mounted Drummer filis the
screen as he beats his two huge instruments with a
flourish. Visually as well as auditorially, this is in
sharpest contrast to the preceding scene. A military
band of about one hundred pieces is blaring out a
martial air.

Camera pulls back to reveal the entire mounted band of

a Moroccan regiment of Chasseurs-a-Cheval, with their
sheep mascot and bell-covered umbrella. Lined up behind
the band is the regiment, in scarlet uniforms, white
capes and turbans.

MED. SHOT - REVIEWING STAND

The colorfully garbed SULTAN addresses General Patton,
whose uniform and decorations are only slightly less
bizarre than those about him.

SULTAN
My people salute you, General --
for your brilliant amphibious
landing on the continent of Africa
-- and for your enlightened
administration of my country.

PATTON
I've enjoyed being here,
Your Excellency. But naturally I'd
prefer to be up at the front in
Tunisia fighting Germans.

The Sultan nods, places the ribbon of a large disc-shaped
decoration around Patton's neck,

TWO SHOT - SULTAN AND PATTON

I appreciate that, Your Excellency.

There is a fanfare from the band and they turn to watch,
21 LONG SHOT - PARADE GROUND

Playing a stirring march, the band moves out to pass in
review, followed by the colorful Chasseurs.

22 MED, SHOT - PATTON AND SULTAN

With Patton's party is LIEUTENANT COLONEL HENRY DAVENPORT,
(fictitious character -- no subtitle). At Patton's

Side is his Aide, CAPTAIN RICHARD N. JENSON. Patton is
both fascinated and impressed by the color and the
pageantry.

23 MED. LONG SHOT

On the parade ground, a battalion of French territorial
infantry in white uniforms passes in review, followed by
Moroccan infantry with the red Fourragere. The streets
are bristling with excited spectators.

24 ANOTHER ANGLE
The strutting commander of the Foreign Legion, leading a

battalion of Legionnaires in traditional white caps and
red epaulets.

25 LONG SHOT ~ PARADE GROUND

The Legion contingent is followed by other exotically
dressed units -- French Senegalese, Goums on horseback
with flowing capes. They are fierce-looking and each
man carries a huge knife. These French colonial troops
Suggest the romantic military splendor of the past.

He and the Sultan return the salute of the unit passing.

SULTAN
Tell me, General what do you think
of Marrakech?

PATTON
I love it, Your Excellency. It's
a combination of Hollywood and the
Bible.

EXT. GERMAN POW ENCLOSURE - MED. SHOT - DAY

Camera moves, with barbed wire fence in f.g., along the
outside of the POW cage, picking up the faces of the
American prisoners inside. They are a grim, bearded,
dirty and dejected lot.

Camera picks up an immaculate Africa Corps staff COLONEL
striding along outside the wire carrying a briefcase.

We follow him as he crosses to a command car in which is
seated a German Field Marshal, surrounded by aides and
staff officers.

MED. SHOT AT COMMAND CAR

ROMMEL, goggles on chest, is studying a map on which an
officer is pointing out dispositions.

SUBTITLE: FIELD MARSHAL ERWIN ROMMEL,
COMMANDER, AFRICA CORPS

The staff Colonel comes into scene, presents himself to
Rommel,

COLONEL
Heil Hitler!
He gets no response from Rommel,
COLONEL

You wanted to see the interrogation
reports on the American prisoners
captured in our victory at Kasserine,
Field Marshal.

(he hands the briefcase

to Rommel's aide)
They are not very good soldiers,
these Americans.

Unimpr essed , Rommel is incisive, thoughtful. He gives
the Colonel a sharp glance.

ROMMEL
I wouldn't be so sure after one
battle. Their tanks were no match
for our guns.

COLONEL
One could say the same, sir, for
their leadership.

Rommel eyes the Colonel evenly. He's not that easily
fiattered. :

ROMMEL
They were not under American command
at Kasserine. They were under British
General Anderson -- did you know that?

COLONEL
(undaunted, he smiles)
British commanders and American
troops. They had the worst of
everything!

ROMMEL
I remind you that Montgomery is
& British commander. And he has
driven us halfway across Africa.

COLONEL
In any case, we have met the
Americans for the first time and
defeated them... Personally, I
feel extremely optimistic.

Rommel eyes him with dry disdain.

ROMMEL
You can afford to be an optimist.
I can't.

EXT, U.S. II CORPS HEADQUARTERS, DJEBEL KOUIF TOWN SQUARE
FULL SHOT - DAY

The jeep bearing Bradley, Carver and Hansen drives up in
front of the headquarters. Lounging dejectedly outside
is a group of unkempt GIs, Bearded and unsoldierly, they
straggle to their feet, some managing a ragged salute.

It is clearly a unit without discipline or morale, a unit
that's suffered defeat.

Bradley and Carver return the salutes as they step out
of the jeep. Bradley studies the soldiers closely as the
jeep pulls away and Hansen goes on inside.

TWO SHOT - BRADLEY AND CARVER

BRADLEY
(quietly, as he eyes
the soldiers)
These men fight at Kasserine?

CARVER
(uneasily)
Yes, sir.

Bradley moves to go inside, changes his mind, turns to
Garver, asking for frankness,

BRADLEY
John, General Eisenhower sent me down
here to make a report and I've got
to lay it on the line. What went
wrong?

CARVER
Everything. Second-rate tanks --
bad intelligence -- green troops...
50 green some of the boys marked
our mine fields for their own
protection and forgot to take the
flags down.

BRADLEY
(eyeing him shrewdly)
Green commanders, too?

CARVER
Yes, sir,

BRADLEY

For the American Army to take a
licking like that our first time
at bat against the Germans --

(he shakes his head)
Up against Rommel we need the best
tank man we've got. Somebody tough
enough to pull this outfit together.

CARVER
(with a quick, apprehensive
glance)
George Patton?

‘ BRADLEY
(enigmatic)
Possibly --

CARVER
God help us.

EXT. THE DESERT - EXTREME FULL VIEW - DAWN

We see the distant apparition of a chain of military
vehicles kicking up the dust as it speeds along the
desert, silhouetted before a great rising rosy sun.

A siren wails, coming out of nowhere and growing louder
and louder, until the half-track,- with banners flying
and machine guns fore and aft, comes at us as ostenta~
tiously as a fire engine. ,

General Patton, in a bulky trench coat, stands upright
in the armored car, his face grimacing into the wind,
a Caesar in his chariot.

EXT, DJEBEL KOUIF TOWN SQUARE - FULL SHOT - DAY

The caravan roars into the decrepit square opposite the
schoolhouse that serves as II Corps Headquarters. Arabs
scurry through the streets in the midst of e cackling
exodus of camels and chickens.

ANOTHER: ANGLE

The caravan comes to a halt before the schoolhouse where
a single SENTRY stands sloppily at his post, Patton
steps over the side of his car, followed by a Lieutenant
and a Captain.

Patton regards the town square and the scruffy-looking
soldiers lounging in it, his face frozen in the same
expression as when it was blown by the wind.

PATTON'S P.O.V.

Groups of unshaven GIs, wearing sweaters and field jackets,
yawning and indescribably slack, pyll themselves to their
feet. Most of them manage a ragged series of salutes.
Others simply watch with mild curiosity.

CLOSE SHOT - PATTON
His jaw tightens, his eyes. begin to flash.
TWO SHOT - CAPTAIN AND LIEUTENANT

They eye the General apprehensively. Jenson 1s a young
man, STILLER in his mid-forties.

AND LIEUTENANT: ALEXANDER C, STILLER,
AIDES TO GENERAL PATTON

CLOSE SHOT - PATTON

Eyes flashing, rage barely under control, he drews hin-
self up and snaps off an ultrasmart salute to the ragged
crew. Turning on his heel, he passes a erudely built

Sign designating II Corps Headquarters, on which a chicken
squats. Nearby an Arab peddier leans, unimpressed, against
a pen of chickens.

ANGLE AT ENTRANCE II CORPS HEADQUARTERS

The Sentry, without tie and needing a shave, pulls hin-
self to attention as Patton approaches. The man manages
a salute, then stares at Patton with a slack-jawed and
not unfriendly smile.

Patton's eyes widen. Incapable of speech, there issues
from within. him a volcanic rumble that is almost a retch.
Failing to return the man's salute, he strides into the
bullding.

JENSON

Sentry, where's the Duty Officer?
SENTRY

Sir, I don!t rightly know.

, JENSON

Is he in the building?
SENTRY

Sir, I'm under the impression he

is not.

Visibly irritated, Jenson goes on into the building,
following Stiller.

INT. II CORPS HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Jenson follows Stiller down the corridor, which is quite
dark because the blackout curtains have not yet been
pulled cpen. Patton can be seen down the corridor,
opening doors, glancing inside, slamming them shut again.

He opens a map room door and steps inside, followed by
Stiller,

INT. MAP ROOM - FULL SHOT

Seated in the map room is a young SECOND’ LIEUTENANT,
smiling contentedly, his feet up on a table, reading a

magazine. Seeing Patton and Stiller, he nervously hops
to attention.

STILLER
What are you doing, Lieutenant?

INT, ANOTHER OFFICE - FULL SHOT

as Jenson enters. There are several desks in the make-
shift office, at one of which sits a sleeping LIEUTENANT.
A SERGEANT concentrates intently on a solitaire layout.
Patton and Stiller appear in the corridor outside, pause
to overhear the conversation.

JENSON
LIEUTENANT!

The Lieutenant pops upright, pulls himself to his feet.
The Sergeant merely looks up; he's seen a lot of captains.

JENSON
(sternly)
Where's the Duty Officer?

LIEUTENANT
Sir, he -= I think he's at his
quarters, shaving.

JENSON
Why isn't he here on duty?

LIEUTENANT
I guess he needed a shave.
(grinning)
We've got a new commanding general
due in today.

Patton appears in the doorway, his face looking like a
storm at sea. The Lieutenant instantly loses his grin.
He hits a rigid attention, yells at the card-playing
Sergeant.

LIEUTENANT
(frenziedly)
Forbes! Snap to!

Patton turns on his heel with a growl of rage and disappears.
INT, CORRIDOR - FOLLOWING PATTON

He angrily moves down the dark corridor. We move faster
and faster to keep up with him, until there is a dull
clunk and Patton practically falls flat on his face. We
hear a groan and then:

VOICE
Who the hell's kicking me in the butt!

A PRIVATE, who had been curled asleep on the corridor floor,
rises, about to punch whomever it was in the nose, when he
realizes that he is face to face with General Patton.

PRIVATE
(coming to a salute)
Oh! Sorry, sir.

JENSON
What were you doing down there,
soldier?

PRIVATE
(decisively)
Trying to get some sleep, sir.

PATTON.
Well, get the hell back down there,
son. You're the only sonuvabitch
in this headquarters whe knows what
he's trying to do!

PRIVATE
Yessir.

he INT, STAIRWAY AND SECOND-FLOOR CORRIDOR - MED. SHOT

Someone pulls aside heavy blackout curtains, letting in
some light. SERGEANT WILLIAM GEORGE MEEKS, Patton's
Negro orderly, and a couple of other enlisted men carry
the Generai's personal gear -- a footlocker marked with
his name and rank, etc. -- up the stairs. Patton himself
passes these bearers on his way upstairs, is met by
Stiller as he reaches the second floor.

STILLER
General Bradley's waiting in your
office, sir.
(pointing to an
office)
Down at the end of the hall.

Patton and Stiller move off down the hall as, unseen by
them, @ couple of enlisted men carry by us a footlocker
marked MAJOR GENERAL LLOYD R, FREDENDALL.

BRADLEY
Fine, George. Good to see you.

watch)
We were all under the impression
that you wouldn't be here until 0900.

PATTON
I gathered that. You know my boys,
don't you? Dick Jenson and Al Stiller.

Bradley nods with a smile.. Patton plants himself behind
the desk, lights a cigar.

PATTON
Tell me, Brad -- what are you
doing here?

BRADLEY
Ike wanted a report on this Kasserine
setback. Meanwhile, I'm supposed to
stay here in your headquarters -- as
an observer -- but I report directly
to Ike. His teyes and ears! was the
way he put it.

Get me General Eisenhower's headquarters.

Jenson picks up the phone.

JENSON
(into phone)
Allied Force Headquarters.

PATTON
What really went wrong at Kasserine?
I've only seen the preliminary report.

BRADLEY
Apparently everything went wrong.
We'd send over a 75mm shell, the
Krauts would return an 88. Their
tanks are diesels -- even when we
managed to hit them they kept running.
The men call our tanks 'Purple Heart
Boxes.' One hot piece of shrapnel
and the gasoline explodes.

BRADLEY
I talked to one soldier about the
half-tracks. Asked him if machine-
gun fire pierced the armor. He
said, 'No, sir -- the bullets only
come in one side and rattle around
a bit.! “

PATTON
I hear we had trouble coordinating
the air cover.

BRADLEY
The trouble was no air cover.

JENSON
(handing him
telephone )
General Smith on the line, sir,

PATTON
(into phone)
Beetle, I'm calling about Bradley
and his job here... Look, I need
a good number two man. I want to
make Brad my deputy commander...
Okay? You clear it with Ike.

He hangs up, takes a mean puff of his cigar, scowls up
at Bradley shrewdly.

PATTON
Now you're not spying for Ike
anymore -- you're working for me.
(challenging)
Okay?

BRADLEY
Fine.

Patton turns to Jenson.

PATTON
Dick -- you got those stars?

JENSON

Yes, sir.

43 Cont.2

Jenson produces a handful of shiny three-star collar
pieces. Patton sits down behind the big desk as Stiller
on one side and Jenson on the other start to pin on the
new insignia. An expression of doubt flashes across
Bradley's face; Patton notices it. ,

PATTON
Hell, I've been nominated by the
President.

BRADLEY

But it isn't official until it's
approved by the Senate.

PATTON
(grinning)
Well -- they have their schedule
and I have mine.

BRADLEY

(watching the aides

work)
George, if you were named Admiral
of the Turkish Navy, I'll bet your
aides could dip into their haversacks
and come up with the appropriate
Dadge of rank. .

(with a grin)
Anyway -- premature congratulations.

Their ceremonial duties over, Stiller goes out and Jensdn
busies himself arranging a desk for himself. Patton rises
and crosses to a mirror to inspect his-new rank, Bradley
crosses to the window.

PATTON
Those stars would look a lot. better
on @ green shirt... Did I ever tell
you I once designed a uniform for
tank crewmen? It was green leather
with red stripes, sort of a row of
brass buttons here and topped by a
gold football helmet.

The Army rejected it. But damn, it,
was beautiful.

Bradley and Patton are still watching down below. Bradley
turns to Patton.

BRADLEY
George, there's one other thing I
put in my Kasserine report, Some
of our boys were just plain scared.

PATTON
They'll get cover that. Even the
best foxhounds are gun-shy the first
time out. I can remember when
nothing scared me worse than the idea
of a bullet coming straight for my
nose. I don't know why, but somehow
the idea of getting it straight in
the nose was just more horrible than
any other possibility.

BRADLEY

such a handsome nose.

soldiers -- they don't act like
soldiers -- why should they fight
like soldiers?!
BRADLEY
No question about it -- the
discipline's pretty poor.
PATTON
(looking at his
watch)
Starting in fifteen minutes, we're
going to turn these boys into razor-
sharp fanatics.

to erupt) .
These men may lose their fear of
Germans, but by God they'll never
lose their fear of me!

Leggings? Hell, General, sir, I'm

A twenty dollar fine.

Scowling, Patton turns away from the flabbergasted Cook
to the others present.

PATTON

Panning with them as they move away, Patton growling to -
Jenson quietly.

PATTON
Hit 'em in the pocketbook and

INT. IMPROVISED SQUAD ROOM - MED. SHOT - DAY

This is a large room that's been converted into enlisted
men's quarters, with rows of bunks, combat gear, ete. As
Patton, accompanied by Jenson, sweeps through the empty
room, his eye falls on a pinup tacked to the wall. We get
a glimpse of a raw, provocative pose of an enormously
bosomed girl. Patton pauses, his Puritan outrage
unmistakable.

PATTON
This is a barracks -- not a bordelio!

He tears the picture off the wall, balls it up and throws
it down sternly. Then he marches out.

EXT. OUTDOOR LATRINE ~ TRUCKING sHoT

Camera follows Patton in f.g. as, in going from squad
room to town square, he happens to pass a row of canvas
stalls, followed by Jenson. Seated in each stall is a
soldier, revealed from the neck up. Patton speaks curtly
as he passes the first stall. The soldier inside ig hat-
less.

PATTON
No heimet -- twenty dollars,
(passing ths
second stall)
No helmet and no leggings --
twenty-five dollars.

He crosses to the third stall where a very young and
sharply turned-out GI sits at attention, a polished
helmet on his head. He looks straight ahead, but his
face wears a vacuous and slightly pained expression
appropriate to what he's doing.

PATTON
Now thet man looks like a soldier!

EXT. DJEBEL KOUIF TOWN SQUARE - MED. SHOT - DAY

Patton and Jenson cross the square to the building being
used for a hospital, They are trailed by wide-eyed
urchins.

PATTON
I do not admit the existence of 'battle
fatigue.' Once you concede its reality,
you admit the reality of demoralization.
And you can't win battles with demoralized
troops. That sort of thing has to be stopped
or you get an uncontrollable infection...
Like conscientious objection.

INT. REAR AREA HOSPITAL - MED. SHOT

Patton, followed by Jenson, moves down the aisle of the
busy ward, where he is met by a MEDICAL OFFICER. Nurses
and other medical personnel (except this medical officer)
all wear helmets.

steam up)

samé Duilding as boys who've been
wounded in battle.

MEDICAL OFFICER

I'll see that they're moved, sir.

PATTON
Another thing -- there'll be no
"battle fatigue' in my command...

MEDICAL OFFICER
Yes, sir.

PATTON

contemptuousily)
Battle fatigue is a free ride; a
little yellow-belly's ticket to

subsidize cowardice.

MEDICAL OFFICER
(eyeing the General
blandly )
Yes, sir --

Patton has started to turn away, but something in the
doctor's tone pulls him back.

59 EXT, DESERT - MED. LONG SHOT - LATE AFTERNOON

A two-and-a-half-ton truck is parked out on the desert
beside the dusty, deserted road. There is nothing else
to be seen for miles. Camera moves in on truck, coming
to rest as it reveals a SERGEANT reclining in the cab,
smoking while he watches a PFC standing beside the cab
shaving. The soldier's tin mirror and helmet full of
water rest on the hood of the truck.

SERGEANT
You know what's so important in
the back of this truck?

Precccupied with shaving, the Pfc shakes his head.

SERGEANT
-. Shoe polish.
PFC
Shoe polish?!
SERGEANT

Georgie Patton is a nut about spit
and polish. If I Jet you turn up
at his headquarters without a shave,
you'd get a month in the stockade.

There is the sound of an approaching vehicle, then the
insistent honking of a horn. The Sergeant, irritated,

sticks his hand out of the cab, without looking, and
motions the other vehicle ahead.

SERGEANT
(impatiently)
Come ahead, you silly bastard!

ANOTHER ANGLE AT TRUCK

PFC
Water, sir --
(helplessly

He told me to shave.

PATTON
{angrily )
I want your head in that helmet --
not water!

back of his hand, Patton sweeps the helmet off
of the truck.

PATTON
Now pick it up and wear it!

As the PFC retrieves his helmet, Patton gestures to his
driver and the jeep roars on out of scene. The PFC is.
stunned by this general who materializes out in the desert
and disappears in a matter of seconds,

PFC
(to Sergeant}
You told me he wanted everybody
to shave,

SERGEANT
I also told you he was a nut!

as the jeep approaches from the distance. “Camera moves
along the silent eternal ruins of what was once an
aqueduct. The car comes to a stop. Patton, dwarfed by
the structure, steps out and looks up at the ancient ruins
in awe. The wind makes an eerie sound through the stone.
MED. SHOT

Bradley steps out of the car, moves closer to Patton.

PATTON
(quietly)
It was here. The battlefield was

here.

(pause)
The Carthaginians defending the
Aqueduct were attacked by three
Roman legions. The Carthaginians
were proud and brave, but they
couldn't hold. Massacre. Arab
women stripped them of their tunics,
their swords, their lances. The
soldiers lay naked in the sun...

68 INT. MAP ROOM - II CORPS HEADQUARTERS - MED. SHOT - DAY

Patton has had the. map room totally revamped and it is
now an elaborate and buzzing center of charts and
information. COLONEL GASTON BELL (fictitious character -

Jenson, Stiller, Hansen and several other OFFICERS, using

a map.

BELL
There's an opportunity here for us
to mount an cffensive. We have
concentrated on harassing the enemy's
flank, to draw his strength away from
the British. However, it appears now
that we could split the Africa Corps
and drive through Rommel to the sea.

PATTON
(sardonically)
Sorry, Bell -- that territory is
reserved for General Sir Bernard
Law Montgomery. We're supposed to
let him win this one --
(sarcastically)
-- no matter how long it takes him
to do it.

BRADLEY
They're entitled to have their hero.
After all, Montgomery pushed Rommel
clear across North Africa.

PATTON
What about the Americans? They need
a hero, too, don't they?

BRADLEY

You have anybody in mind, George?

-- I don't have to stand for that! .

CONINGHAM
I sincerely apologize for that
remark -- whoever made it.
{with a smile)
And I promise you one thing, General
~- you'll see no more German planes,

In that instant, without time even for the raising of
Patton's eyebrow, four Heinkel fighter-bombers roar over
the building, spattering machine-gun fire. The room
rocks, plaster flakes from the ceiling, and the three men
flatten themselves on the floor.

THREE SHOT ON FLOOR

A satisfied Patton looks over at his. fellow officers,
resplendent in their uniforms.

EXT. BULLDING - MED, SHOT - PATTON

Camels stampeding all around him. From a shoulder holster
he draws a pistol, fires at the planes. The fighter-
pombers soar off as quickly as they came. Patton peers
back at the amazed group of officers. Buford offers his
arm to get Patton back into the building. Coningham
shakes his head.

CONINGHAM

Now how the devil did you ever
manage to stage that?

PATTON

If I could find the Nazi sonsuvbitches

The crosses over the graves -- and an occasional Star of

I'd send that genius sonuvabitch an
engraved invitation in iambic

stanzas to meet me alone out in the
desert.

JENSON
I'll deliver it.

PATTON

Rommel in his tank and me in mine.
We'd stop at twenty paces, climb
out of the turrets and shake hands.
Then we'd button up and do battle
-- just the two of us. And that
battle would decide the outcome of
the war. .

JENSON
Too bad jousting's gone out of
style. It's like your poetry,
General -- it isn't part of the
Twentieth Century.

PATTON
Yeah, maybe so. The world grew
up. Helluva shame... Dick, I want
guards posted around this area.
If we don't, the damn Arabs'll dig
them up to get their uniforms.

JENSON

I want these men taken care of.
Our graves mustn't disappear into

Young women in uniform - the "Grey Mice" - operate a

CAPTAIN STEIGER, a junior staff officer whose gentle,
studious manner suggests the university rather than the
Wehrmacht, makes his way across the bustling room to

On a rise, in outline against the reddening sky, is a
two-wheel ammunition caisson. Atop the caisson is a
stretcher on which is a man's body in a white GI mattress
cover, Camera moves in.

PATTON'S VOICE
{o.9.)
Captain Richard N. Jenson was a
fine boy - lcyal, unselfish and
efficient. I am terribly sorry.

A hand uncovers the face of Jenson and camera reveals
Patton as he touches the face, then kisses it and finally
kneels beside the caisson. Camera lifts away to reveal
Meeks-and Patton's Driver bringing up a pair of black-
blanketed horses which they hitch to the yoke of the
caisson.

PATTON'S VOICE
(o.s.)

There are no coffins here, since
there is no wood...We will have

a trumpeter and honor guard, but
we will not fire the volleys, as
it would make people think an air
raid was on.

Exhausted groups of British troops in faded summer
combat dress have come face to face with equally
battle-worn American troops in their heavyweight
combat 0.D.s. In contrast to the high-key narration,
we see that the cameramen, trying not to be included,
are frantically signaling the diffident men to greet
each other in some sort of enthusiastic demonstration.
Very obviously taking directions, the soldiers per-

shake hands -- all for the folks back home. Overhead

Montgomery, a totally different personality but just
as image-conscious in his own way, is dressed in beret,
turtle-neck sweater and corduroy pants. As his jeep
drives alongside a column of British troops, he favors
them with a wave and a “one of the boys" smile -- even
reaches out to shake a few hands as he passes. The
men cheer him wildly.

Bradley is seated on an ammo box in front of his tent,
with a towel draped around his neck, as a GI gives him

a haircut. Suddenly the sound of an approaching aircraft
cuts the stillness. Bradley looks up, frowning, as it
roars by close overhead.

Patton grins and waves to Bradley from the small spotter
plane, which is coming in for a landing.

Jodl's staff, including Steiger, are gathered around a

I'm asking you now. You think
Patton will attack Sardinia?

STEIGER
No, sir.

JODL
Why not?

STEIGER

Patton, sir, is a military historian.
He knows that Sicily, not Sardinia,
has always been the key to Italy. If
Patton has anything to say about it,
he will probably attack Sicily at
Syracuse --

(with a faint,

fond smile)
-- as the Athenians did.

JODL
(impatient and
annoyed )}
Steiger --! This is the Twentieth
Century!

STEIGER
But you must understand, General --
Patton is a Sixteenth Century man.

He digs a volume out of his pile of books, flips to a
marked page.

STEIGER

Just listen to this:

(reading)
‘On a quiet street in New York, in
nineteen twenty-two, Patton was on
his way to a dinner, wearing white
tie and tails, when he came upon
three men pushing a young girl into
the back of a truck. He leaped out
of his car, produced a revolver, and
forced the men at gunpoint to release
the woman.'

{as though this

were the punch line

of a@ marvelous joke)
It turned out the woman was the
fiancee of one of the men, and he
was merely helping her into the
truck!

Army and Navy officers and their aides speed back and
forth and there is a mumble of conversation. LInUTENANT
GOLONEL CHARLES R. CODMAN, a dapper debonair and
unflappable man in his mid-forties, starts forward as
Patton enters, then stops.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Colonel (now full Colonel) Davenport moves across the
room toward Patton, pre-empting the General's attention.

DAVENPORT
Excuse me, General --

Patton is distracted by his cigar, which has gone dead.
He puffs frantically, but it is out. Almost instantly
Codman appears in scene, whips out a Zippo and lights
the General's cigar. Patton accepts the light without
noticing Codman. His job with the Zippo done, Codman
disappears from the scene. Davenport resumes, glancing
at paper in his hand.

DAVENPORT
Sir, this is interesting. We've
discovered that Rommel wasn't present
at El Guettar.

PATTON
(taking this as a
personal affront)
Who says 30?

DAVENPORT
G-2, sir.

DAVENPORT

He puffs frantically but the cigar has gone dead again.

As if by magic, Codman appears, applies the lighted Zippo.
Patton gets the cigar going, notices Codman for the first
time.

PATTON
(growling)
Who the hell are you?

CARVER
General, this is Lieutenant Colonel
Codman, your new aide.

PATTON
Oh, yes.
(remembering)
I pulled your name off the list
because I know your family.

CcODMAN
I'm glad you aid, sir.

PATTON

Codman, that Kraut Rommel is ths
best they have -- and I kicked hell
out of him. Now my own G-2 section
is trying to tell me he wasn't even
there!

cODMAN
(polite, diplomatic,

soothingly quiet)
But, General, he undoubtedly planned
the German battie.

Patton glares at him, frowning, unsure of Codman's point.

cODMAN
If you defeat Rommel's plan, you've
defeated Rommel. Isn't that true, sir?

Somewhat mollified, Patton takes a long pull on the cigar
as he studies his new aide, finds more here than meets the
eye. Obviously a man of taste and discretion.

Camera moves through the alcove into a palatial dining
room, where a magnificent table is laid in the classic

There is a mumble of dinner conversation as the camera
moves along one side of the table, revealing the elegantly

Peloponnesian War: ‘If Syracuse falls,
all Sicily falls -- then Italy!' He
Imew that Syracuse was the jugular of

INT. REICHSCHANCELLERY - MAP ROOM - DAY

On a screen in the darkened room we see projected in
black and white (and without sound) uncut U.S. Signal
Corps footage of Patton landing on the beach at Gela.
Harkins and other staff officers are with hin.

In some of the shots Signal Corps cameramen appear with

their hand-held Eyemos. Patton steps off a landing craft
and wades ashore with his fiercest expression, pistols on
his hips, shiny helmet gleaming, surrounded by his staff.

Since this is uncut footage, we see the Signal Corps
slate -- PATTON - SICILY LANDING - ROLL 3. There follows
other angles of the same action, revealing that this is
staged for the cameras with Patton's willing - if not
eager - cooperation. We even see him put on his fierce
warlike scowl the moment the cameras roil.

with his troops on another beach. Wearing ordinary GI
uniform except for the stars on his helmet, he steps into
the surf with a few of his staff, carrying a carbine and
almost indistinguishable from the soldiers landing with
him. The whole tone is as unpretentious and businesslike
as Patton was flamboyant.

Sir, General Alexander's gotten
wind of your westerly movement.
He says here: ‘Stop immediately.
Go no farther than Agrigento.
Repeat, stop immediately.'

PATTON

for a moment)
That's what you think it says.
But I think it was garbled in
transmission. Ask them to re-
transmit the message -- and take
your time about it.

That'll take half a day at least.

Yes, sir.

Bradley's jeep, in which are Bradley, his driver, Hansen
and Bradley's Second Aide, drives along a road by a farm-
house held by an American infantry platoon. From a

As the jeep approaches the farmhouse, the shelling grows
more intense. A shell hits too close for comfort and, at
a signal from Bradley, a11 four men bail out.

Bradley and his party take cover. As a shell hits nearby,
a GI from the infantry platoon aiso dives for cover behind

Moving on, Patton has to pause as a mobile stretcher is
pushed by. On it is a man's body, covered completely by
a sheet. Patton moves on to a bed where a soldier lies
pale and motionless under an oxygen mask. The man is
unconscious and he is breathing heavily and with difficulty.
His entire upper body is heavily bandaged. Patton turns
to Codman with a gesture, and Codman produces a Purple
Heart medal out of a briefcase he carries. Patton pins
the medal onto the piilowcase of the unconscious soldier.

The soldier actually starts crying now and Patton slaps
him hard across the face.

Patton strikes the man again. The man's helmet liner

in contrast with the American troops the men of the Eighth
Army dress any way they please. Because of the heat, most
of them are half naked. One of the enlisted men shouts
out as his tank passes the sweater-wearing General.

BRITISH SOLDIER
Hello, there, Monty.

MONTGOMERY
Hello, yourself.

Another vehicle has a driver who is absolutely naked and
wears a silk top hat. He laughingly tips his hat to his
General. Montgomery breaks out into laughter; then, after
that vehicle passes, turns to his Aide dryly:

MONTGOMERY
Issue an order: Henceforth, top
hats will not be worn by members
of the Highth Army.

Another vehicle full of cheering men passes.

SECOND BRITISH SOLDIER
Fifty kilometers to Messina, Monty!

He waves back, smiling and nodding.

Highland Pipers strut proudly toward the main square of
the bomb-damaged town, their pipes blaring. Montgomery's
command car is behind them. They round a corner; then
stop, thes wind in the bags remaining for a dissonant

steps forward so he can look around the corner.

Patton, with folded arms, standing before the town hall,

(TRUCKING) = NIGHT

Camera moves ahead of Patton and Meeks as they move through
a series of offices toward Patton's private office.

PATTON

It is my belief, Meeks, that the
temple We saw today marks the spot
where Hasdrubal committed suicide
in 397 B.C., and that the Greeks
built that temple to celebrate the
act. But when the Carthaginians
came back, they destroyed it.

MEEKS
Yes, sir.

PATTON
On second thought, I am not sure if
it was Hasdrubal or the old Hannibal.
Anyhow, when he saw that the battle
was lost, he jumped on the funeral

pyre.

They ‘have arrived in Patton's private office, where Codman
is arranging a tray on Which he has an ice bucket with a
bottle of champagne and several glasses. He is trans-
ferring a pile of envelopes from the tray to Patton's desk.

CODMAN
Good evening, General. Just want to
make a report on a private poll I've
been taking.

PATTON
What poll?

C ODMAN

The fan mail. Eleven percent ‘con' --
eighty-nine percent ‘pro’. That
eleven percent of protest in most
cases are both obscene and anonymous,
But the 'pro' letters are mostly
from relatives and servicemen.

'I want you to know that we are proud

clear)

Patton opens the envelope and reads the message. He is
quite literally stunned.

They've relieved me from command of

Welcome to London, Georgie.

Patton turns to Smith and his arrogance subsides. He is
mentally exhausted and deeply apprehensive. Smith is
businesslike, unbending, humorless.

PATTON
Hello, Beetle. Is... is Ike here?

SMITH
He asked me to brief you.
(to Codman and
the Corporal)
Excuse us, please.

Codman and the Corporal quickly take their leave, closin;
the mirrored door, Smith makes himself comfortable in one
of the plump chairs.

SMITH
First of all, I want to put you
C) straight about Ike. We hear a

lot about you criticizing his
decisions.

PATTON
No, Beetle, not really. Hell, you
know I'm just a damn fool, but some-
times I wonder whether he's a Limey
at heart.

SMITH
George, this is the toughest coalition
ever attempted in history. Ike sits
on top, trying to hold it together
and lick the Germans at the same time.
Believe me, it's one hell of a job.

PATTON
I know that. But, Beetle --

SMITH
We have an important job for you in
connection with the Normandy invasion --

PATTON
I've studied the “verlord plan, and
it has one serious flaw. It depends

Please -- will you just listen

with a rope around his neck.

(with finality)
We're going to let it leak out
that you're here under cover --
that you're preparing to invade
at the Pas de Calais. We hope to
pin down the German Fifteenth Army
there so they can't be used against
us in Normandy.

PATTON
(deeply shaken)
Is that all rou people think I'm
good for?

SMITH

(ignoring this)
We're building an army of twelve
divisions around you -- all
fictitious, of course. Dummy
troop concentrations, dummy landing
craft and simulated radio traffic...
You see, the Germans are convinced
that you're going to lead the main
invasion effort...The German agents
will spot you here before long.
Then wetll move you to your new
headquarters in Knutsford.

What do I do there?

Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

Patton is waiting in a large anteroom what has a quiet
but vigorous excitement about it. Staff officers bob out
of this door, into that one. A door opens and General
Bradley comes out. Patton notices him with pleasure.

PATTON
Brad!

Bradley has important things on his mind, but he is
pleased to see his old boss.

BRADLEY
Good to see you. How is everything?

Bedell Smith sticks his head out of the office marked
GENERAL EISENHOWER, beckons to Bradley.

SMITH
Oh, General Bradley --

Bradley turns to find Smith beckoning him to come into
Ike's office. This, of course, is a command.

BRADLEY
Excuse me, Will you, George.

PATTON
Sure, Brad. See you later --

Bradley has followed Smith into the office, leaving Patton
aione and very much out of things.

EXT, TOWN OF KNUTSFORD - MED, LONG SHOT - DAY

An all-female brass band, resplendent in their Women's
Land Army uniforms, is playing with a good deal mors
enthusiasm than talent. A large group of ladies stands
outside the new Xnutsford "Welcome" Club, attached to
the front of which is a large red, white and blue banner
reading: KNUTSFORD WELCOMES OUR AMERICAN ALLIES.

The band plays The Stars and Stripes Forever as Patton's
car pulls up into the crowd, Which seems to be populated
solely by middle-aged and older women.

Patton's Packard comes to a stop by Codman who opens the
door. He is surprised by a menacing white English bull
terrier, who is immediately wpon him. Patton steps out,
holding the dog's leash.

He feels a fish out of water in this frumpy and frilly
environment.

MRS. SMITH
General Patton is not here in his

assured him most earnestly that
nothing he says will be quoted...
May I present: General Patton.

Patton rises, a little flush-faced, as the British ladies

applaud.

Codman leans over and whispers to him:

CODMAN
Remember, sir -- watch your language.

Patton takes his place at the podium.

PATTON
My dear ladies, until today my only
experience in welcoming has been to
welcome Germans and Italians to the
infernal regions. In this I have
been quite successful, as the troops
whom I have had the honor to command
have killed or captured some 170,000
of our enemies.

With that the ladies go into another dainty round of
applause, a few of them shouting in their meek little

voices:

A titter

"Hear, hear!"

PATTON
I feel that such elubs as this are

-of vary real value because I believe

and the Americans are two people
separated by a common language.

During the applause that follows, Codman leans. forward,
tries to get Patton's attention.

CODMAN
(during the applause)
The Russians! Don't forget the
Russians!

Patton turns but can't hear what Codman is saying because
of the applause. Scowling at Codman, he turns back and
proceeds.

PATTON
A club like this is an ideal place
for promoting mutual understanding.
As soon as our soidiers meet and
know the English ladies and write
home and tell our women: how truly .
lovely you are,the sooner the
American ladies will get jealous
and force this war to a quick
termination. And I will then get
a chance to go to the Pacific and
kill Japanese.

More enthusiastic applause rings through the crowd and the
littie ladies stand up, some on tiptoe, to honor the
General. The band starts to play.

Several small parachutes blossom open below the circling

commanders rush to open the tubular packets attached to
the chutes. Maps are unrolled and the tank commanders
remount their vehicles. Ina few moments the tank engines
are roaring as they speed onward again.

There is a broad triumphant grin on Patton's face as the

grin back as Patton passes, On his face, as he feels the

‘thrill of this hell-for-leather dash, is an expression

close to ecstasy.

Several ambulances are trying to cross the main road, and
a heavy traffic snarl has developed. Two tanks are

The roaring lash of his tongue having broken the log jam,
he now directs traffic witn the magnificent grace of a
Roman policeman. He is interrupted by Hansen, who salutes
and reports that Bradley wants to see him. (The roar of
the vehicles drowns out all dialogue.) Turning the traffic
control back to the MP, Patton leaps down from his gasoline
drum, moves over to join Bradley.

Patton's jeep, driven by Codman, appears in the distance,
moves toward camera. As it negotiates a little bend in
the road, Patton signals Codman to stop. They both get
out, staring at the road ahead.

LONG SHOT - RIAD (THEIR P.9.V.)

In the gray silence of early dawn the devastation of last
night's tank battle can be seen, An SS panzer detachment,
an awesome collection of tanks, field guns, ambulances and
trucks, lies scattered along the road, the vehicles dead
and burned out. ‘Two of the three American tanks can be
seen, one blasted open, its insides still smoking.

Patton and Codman move past camera into scene. They move
forward without words, fascinated by the strange silent
atmosphere of this killing ground.

CLOSE SHOT + PATTON (MOVING)
as he surveys the scene.
WHAT HE SEES

Vehicles and field pieces are blasted and charred. And
everywhere -- in the vehicles, in the ditch, in the field
beside it -- are the corpses of German soldiers. Dead
men sit in trucks as if still driving. Wounded men, now
dead, spill crazily out of an ambulance. Aman sits
upright at his field piece as though asleep.

CAPTAIN
Iwas in conmand... My tank platoon
was supporting an infantry company.
Tanks ran out of gas -- so we had to
fight it out. We started eleven
o'clock last night, finished a couple
of hours ago.

Patton looks up and notices that in the field nearby are
American and German dead, seemingly in each other's embrace.

CAPTAIN
This morning the fighting was hand-
to-hand.

Patton looks at the Gaptain, then suddenly takes the
exhausted face in his hands and kisses the man on the
forehead. Camera follows Patton as he moves off, deeply
moved, and continues to explore the strange, silent battle-
ground.

ANOTHER ANGLES

He proceeds a few more steps, totally immersed in the
eerie scene. Then he pauses, pulls out of his pocket an
old folded Michelin touring map, glances at it fondly.

PATTON

You know, Cod -- it always comes

it turns into a dream. Then I've

gallons of gasoline.

(tapping the map

again with his

finger)
Right now, this is the weak spot.
Ten days and I could be in Berlin.

CODMAN
What about the fortifications at
Verdun and Metz?

PATTON

Fixed fortifications are man's
monument to stupidity.

(confidently)
When mountain ranges and oceans can
be overcome, anything built by man
can be overcome.

(smiling, like a

poy with a riddle)
You know how I know they're finished
out there?

Codman shakes his head.

PATTON
The carts. They're using carts to
lug their supplies and wounded.

Camera moves close to Patton and, for a moment, we almost
can remember the spectacle he describes.

PATTON
In my dream I saw the carts. They
kept buzzing around in my head and
I couldn't figure out why. Then fi
remembered: the nightmare in the
snow -- the endless, agonizing retreat
from Moscow. God the cold! The wounded,
and what was left of the supplies, were
thrown into carts. Napoleon was finished.
No color left, not even the red of blood.
Only snow.

He pauses for a long moment, looking at the battlefield.

PATTON
(with deep inner
excitement)
Just look at that, Codman. Compared tc
war, all other forms of human endeavor

EXT. VILLAGE - MED. LONG SHOT

An American tank, buttoned up, advances down the street
scattering cows, pigs and chickens. It is taking heavy
fire from a building. The tank rumbles up to the building,
pokes the muzzle of its gun through a window and blasts
away, silencing the opposition.

EXT, WINTRY ROADSIDE - MED. SHOT - DAY

Patton, Davenport and Codman are in a jeep watching a
mechanized outfit roll by on the snow-covered icy road.
It's an impressive sight: self-propelled guns, rocket
launchers, heavy equipment of all kinds and men --
hundreds of men -- rolling forward.

God, I'm proud of these men.

knocking out the two German tanks and delivering a withering

heavy casualties. An American armored spearhead follows the
lead tanks, with infantrymen clinging to the sides of the

There is fallen plaster from nearby shellbursts. Jodl,
literal-minded even in chaos, works feverishly to destroy

through a pile of Patton material on his desk.

STEIGER

lost on Jodi,

A balalaika band of Russian soldiers is playing. There
are dancers and acrobats performing. Patton stands
talking with Codman and Davenport as a RUSSIAN GENERAL,
complete with medals, approaches with a civilian
INTERPRETER. The Russian smiles affably and Patton
scowls ferociously as the Interpreter speaks to him in
English. A waiter appears, bearing a tray on which are
two stiff drinks.

You tell him word for word -- and

The Interpreter turns, red-faced and apologetic, and repeats
Patton's reply in Russian. The General flushes angrily,
glares at Patton and for a moment an international explosion
seems likely, Then, controlling himself, the Russian gets
off a couple of quick sentences to the Interpreter in
Russian.
INTERPRETER

The General says he thinks you

devoid of decorations, bearing only the four stars of his
rank. As Patton studies his unfamiliar image in the mirror,

alone, deep in his own unhappiness, and is surprised to
find himself facing Bradley, who has actually been waiting
for him. Bradley now wears four stars.

PATTON
I've been relieved, Brad. They've
taken Third Army away from me.

BRADLEY
I know.
(he tries to sound casual)
I thought we might have dinner together
tonight --

PATTON
: (touched and grateful)

That's damn thoughtful, Brad, and
I appreciate it.

(gesturing toward his

jeep across the street)
Right now I'm going to take Willy for 4

Bradley joins him as they move across the sidewalk. A man
is unhitching a team of oxen from a cart parked in the
street. As the oxen are removed, the cart starts rolling
down the icy street. Gathering speed, it is headed straight
for Patton as he steps off the curb.

BRADLEY
George -- look out!

Patton manages to leap out of the way just in time, and the
cart crashes to a stop against a parked car.

ANOTHER ANGLE
as Patton gets up, brushes the snow off his uniform.

PATTON
(wryly)
After all I've been through, imagine
me getting killed by an oxcart.

Bradley grins. Patton continues moodily.

PATTON
You know -- there's only one proper
end for a professional soldier. A
quick. death inflicted by the last
bullet of the last battle.

They move on across the street, camera panning with them.
TWO SHOT - PATTON AND BRADLEY (TRUCKING)

They walk down the sidewalk on the opposite side of the
street.

PATTON
In our drive across Europe Third
Army liberated twelve thousand
cities and towns -- inflicted a
million and a half enemy casualties.

BRADLEY
(thoughtfully)
I have a-feeling that from now on
just being a good soldier won't be
enough. I'm afraid wetre going to
have to be dislomats and
administrators, too.

PATTON
(growling his
disgust)
God help us!

They have come to Patton's parked jeep where his driver
is holding Willy. He hands the leash to Patton, who takes
the dog.

BRADLEY
George -=- I just want to say one
thing -- you've done a magnificent
job here in Europe... I think that
soldier you slapped back in Sicily
did more to win the war than any
other private in the Army.

Overwhelmed by Bradley's generosity, Patton's face breaks
into &@ big, sudden grin.

PATTON
See you for dinner.

He turns away, leading Willy with him, and Bradley watches
him go.

MED, LONG SHOT

as Patton moves down a short side street, beyond which

we can see open snow-covered countryside. An enormous

windmill turns slowly. In f.g., a group of GIs is busy
werking, hauling supplies.

PATTON'S VOICE
{o.s.)
For over a thousand years, Roman
conquerors returning from the wars
enjoyed the honor of a triumph, a
tumultuous parade.

LONG SHOT - SNOWY COUNTRYSIDE

As Patton and Willy walk together toward the ice-covered
windmill, stark against the snow. Its creaking sound
combined with the sound of the wind, produces a strange
effect.

PATTON'S VOICE
{o.s.)
In the procession came trumpeters
and musicians and strange animals
from the conquered territories...

ANOTHER ANGLE

Patton's figure stands out against the otherwise absolutely
white snowscape. The windmill, with its eerie sound, is
still in frame.

deep in thought, his eyes fixed on some middle-distance
of his own.

PATTON'S VOICE
(o.s.)
The conqueror rode in a triumphal
chariot, the dazed prisoners walking
in chains before him.

EXTREMELY HIGH ANGLE

The distant figure of Patton, headed toward the creaking
windmill, is tiny against the vast expanse of snow.

PATTON'S VOICE -
{o.s.) .

Sometimes his children, robed in
white, stood with him in the chariot,
or rode the trace horses... A slave
stood behind the conqueror, holding
& golden crown and whispering in his
ear @ warning that all glory is
fleeting...

The figure of Patton kas disappeared -- and there is only
the ice-covered windmill and the whiteness of the snow.

BRADLEY'S VOICE
(o.s.)
Within a few weeks, George Patton
died of injuries received when his
staff car collided with a truck
near the German city of Mannheim.

FADE OUT
